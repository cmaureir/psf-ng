 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Mason Egger
* **Previous Board Service**: No
* **Employer**: Temporal
* **Other Affiliations**: PyTexas Foundation
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	# My Python Community Journey
	
	
	Hello! My name is Mason Egger. I am currently a Sr. Technical Curriculum Developer at Temporal Technologies, developing education materials around Temporal's open source offering. Prior to my work at Temporal, I held Developer Relations roles at Gretel.ai and DigitalOcean, as well as Software Engineering roles at Vrbo and Forcepoint. I am also currently the president of the [PyTexas Foundation](https://pytexas.org)
	
	
	I've been working in Python my entire career, first picking it up to work on a Django app while I was in college back in 2013\. I began speaking at Python Conferences in [2019](https://pytexas.org/2019), starting with PyTexas. After this, I volunteered to help organize the PyTexas Conference in [2020](https://pytexas.org/2020), helping take the conference virtual. After a hiatus in 2021, the [PyTexas Conference](https://pytexas.org/conference) returned in\-person in Spring of [2022](https://pytexas.org/2022) with me as the Conference Chair. It was at this time that I was also elected to serve as president of the board for the PyTexas Foundation, the non\-profit organization that puts on the conference. I have served as Conference Chair for the [2023](https://pytexas.org/2023), [2024](https://pytexas.org/2024) and upcoming [2025 PyTexas Conference](https://pytexas.org/2025). In my time as president, I have overseen the rebirth of the PyTexas Conference attendance from 1/5th the typical attendance in 2022 to breaking every previous record in 2024 (our largest and most active conference yet).
	
	
	I have also led the PyTexas Foundation in its expansion in providing resources and programs to the Python community in Texas. I am one of the founding members of the [PyTexas Community Discord](https://discord.gg/jNPAbcNukj) and the [PyTexas Virtual Meetup](https://pytexas.org). I am also leading the effort to provide funding and resources to local Python meetups within Texas ([Katy Python Coders](https://www.meetup.com/katy-python-coders/) \& [DFW Pythoneers](https://www.meetup.com/dfwpython/)) as well as revitalize dormant in\-person meetups ([San Antonio Python Learners](https://www.meetup.com/alamo-python-learners/) and [PyHou](https://www.meetup.com/python-14/)).
	
	
	I hope to bring my experience from rebuilding and fostering Python communities in Texas to the PSF Board. 
	
	
	# My Goals if Elected
	
	
	The Python Software foundation is already doing a *fantastic* job in regard to the Python Community. If elected, these are the primary objectives I would like to dedicate my effort towards:
	
	
	
		- Fostering the growth and development of local communities
		- Promote collaboration across global Python communities
		- Help source and attract more funding for the PSF and its mission
	### Fostering the Growth and Development of Local Communities
	
	
	I strongly believe that the strength of the Python Community, and by extension the PSF, has its foundations in local communities. The majority of people active within the Python Community will never attend PyCon US, while even more will never attend a Python conference. These members make up our meetups, our online communities, contribute to open\-source projects and more. By focusing on local communities, we meet the community where they are. As a result, we attract more members into the global community. By uplifting communities around the world, we create a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive space within the Python ecosystem.
	
	
	I would like to contribute to the work the PSF is already doing to support these various groups, and provide guidance, resources, and funding when needed. 
	
	
	Examples of this could consist of:
	\* Providing guides on how to start a meetup/conference, how to get grants from the PSF, possible venue ideas
	\* Creating a network of speakers, both local and remote, who are willing to speak at events
	\* partnering with specific companies like Galvanize or Capital Factory to provide in\-person venue space for Python meetups in the area.
	
	
	### Promote Collaboration Across Global Python Communities
	
	
	With the rise of virtual meetups and conferences over the past few years, it has become easier than ever to interact with Python communities across the globe. Prior to the foundation of Conference Chats, community organizers didn't have a consistent way of communicating with each other, or sharing resources (such as speakers, sponsor contacts, tools, etc.). I think it is the opportune time to create a network of Python community organizers to act as guides and collaborators across events. 
	
	
	I would like to create a global community of Python community organizers where they can trade ideas, speakers, tips \& tricks, and more. I hope this will encourage more collaboration across the Python communities across the world.
	
	
	### Help Source and Attract More Funding for the PSF and its Mission
	
	
	The PSF has many programs that it generously funds within the Python community. These programs require money to run, and even more if new programs are desired. Current economic factors have led to a decrease in funding across the entire open\-source ecosystem, with some programs having to close as a result. While the PSF is not currently in such dire circumstances, it is important to always work towards continual financial security. 
	
	
	I would like to explore new funding mechanisms for the PSF outside the traditional donation based system, as well as try to attract more sponsors using the current system that is in place. 
	
	
	# Conclusion
	
	
	Thank you for considering me for the Python Software Foundation Board of Directors. It is a great honor to be nominated. For more information about me, you can visit [my website](https://mason.dev) or find me on [social media](https://mason.dev/links).* **Nomination Statements**:
 
 

***Nomination by***: 
 

I wholeheartedly endorse Mason for the PSF board. Mason cares greatly about the Python community and ecosystem, and has poured many hours into building it up, not only vocationally and in organizing PyTexas, but also in advocating and supporting other regional Python conferences, meetups, and community in general. Mason has experience and interest in tech education generally, and consistently puts the language community as a whole ahead of himself and the organizations he is involved with, and would be a voice for local and regional community organizers on the PSF board.

## [Tania Allard](/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/tania-allard/)




 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Tania Allard
* **Previous Board Service**: 2021\-2024
* **Employer**: Quansight Labs
* **Other Affiliations**: PSF Code of Conduct Working Group, PSF User Success Working Group, PSF Fellow, PyLadies Global Council, PyLadiesCon, Mentored Sprints
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	Hi I am Tania Allard. I am a Mexican living in the UK. I am also the Director of Quansight Labs, a not\-for\-profit organisation dedicated to building and maintaining sustainable open\-source projects and their communities within the Python scientific computing ecosystem.
	I currently serve on the PSF Code of Conduct Working Group and the PyLadies Global Council, and I just completed a three\-year term on the PSF Board. I have been an active member of the Python community for over a decade (almost 15 years, and roughly the same time in the Scientific Computing community). Through these years, I have a track record of building diverse and inclusive communities, supporting, mentoring, and empowering others in our community (for example, through the organisation of Mentored Sprints), co\-organising and supporting conferences, contributing to, maintaining, and helping secure funding for open\-source projects, and, more recently, helping make the PSF do better work.
	I am a regular speaker, keynoter, PSF Fellow, Jupyter Distinguished Contributor, emeritus chair of DISC (Diversity and Inclusion in Scientific Computing), and Python UK Association emeritus trustee.
	
	
	During my first term, I:
	
	
	
		- Co\-facilitated strategic discussions around improving and strengthening PSF initiatives aimed at better serving our global community
		Served on the PyCon US committee and PyCon US Code of Conduct Enforcement team
		- Responded to the multiple challenges derived from the global pandemic and its impact on PSF\-related initiatives around grant giving, project funding, and events organisation
		- Worked closely with the PSF to formalise the PyLadies status as a PSF fiscal sponsoree. This allows us to better support the global PyLadies community, especially the global chapter organisers.
		- Participated in and facilitated numerous strategic discussions with a breadth of groups, maintainers, and Python users within our community to understand how the PSF could better serve our ever\-growing Python user base. Thanks to this, I was also able to shepherd and co\-lead the creation of a PSF Working Group focused on user success (that will oversee wide\-reaching and encompassing areas such as accessibility, user experience, newcomers onboarding, usability and discoverability of tools and resources, and internationalisation and localisation).
	If elected, I would like to focus on the following:
	
	
	## Continue to improve and strengthen PSF programmes and initiatives (for example, Grants and associated processes, D\&I working group)
	
	
	Our community has grown and evolved significantly over the years. During my term as a director, I have realised that some of our processes and initiatives need improvements to match our community's diverse and evolving needs. External factors such as changes in the overall tech industry stability and pandemics have also significantly impacted our community and strained the support and funding processes we have relied on until now.
	I want to continue working with multiple working groups across the PSF and iterate on/refine processes and mechanisms to empower these groups and help the PSF achieve its mission of growing sustainably. I also want to broaden the feedback and communication channels between the community and the PSF to ensure that these processes are anchored and driven by the real needs of our community members, newcomers, and leaders.
	
	
	## Continue to build and strengthen partnerships with sister communities, in particular, the Scientific Python
	
	
	One of my priorities is and will continue to build bridges across intersectional communities. As someone coming from the Scientific Computing and PyData sides of the Python community, I see and appreciate the need to build bridges and create spaces where we all converge and hold discussions around community\-wide strategic areas such as supply chain security, interoperability, cross\-platform compatibility, accessibility and usability, packaging and distribution, and emerging and trending areas such as AI and Machine Learning. 
	
	
	I will continue to find ways to facilitate the creation of such spaces and make it easier to fund these efforts through avenues such as our developer\-in\-residence programme, industry partnerships, and other funding activities.
	
	
	## Work towards improving overall user experience and accessibility of PSF resources and beyond.
	
	
	Python's popularity and reach have massively grown over the last few years (and decades, for that matter), and there are no signs of this trend slowing down in the upcoming years. However, several improvements are overdue regarding straightforward and streamlined onboarding resources for Python newcomers, accessibility (for people with disabilities) and usable tools, websites, documentation sites, and more. I want to focus on such much\-needed improvements, better\-defining success pathways for newcomers to the language and improving the user experience of Python tools and resources (primarily as part of the User Success Working Group).
	
	
	Additionally, I would like to collaborate with existing internationalisation and translation volunteer groups to provide better access to our global community and to ensure proper support for these incredible volunteer groups.

	Hola, soy Tania Allard. Soy originaria de México, pero vivo en el Reino Unido. También soy la directora de Quansight Labs, una organización sin fines de lucro enfocada en construir y mantener proyectos de código abierto sostenibles y sus comunidades dentro del ecosistema de computación científica en Python.
	
	
	Actualmente, soy miembro del Grupo de Trabajo del Código de Conducta de la PSF y del Consejo Global de PyLadies, y acabo de completar un período de tres años en la Junta de la PSF. He sido miembro activo de la comunidad de Python durante más de una década (casi 15 años, y aproximadamente el mismo tiempo en la comunidad de Computación Científica). A lo largo de estos años, tengo un historial de construcción de comunidades diversas e inclusivas, apoyando, mentorando y empoderando a otros en nuestra comunidad (por ejemplo, a través de la organización de Mentored Sprints), coorganizando y apoyando conferencias, contribuyendo, manteniendo y ayudando a asegurar financiamiento para proyectos de código abierto y, más recientemente, ayudando a que la PSF haga un mejor trabajo.
	
	
	Soy una conferencista habitual, oradora principal, PSF Fellow, Contribuyente Distinguida de Jupyter, presidenta emérita de DISC (Diversidad e Inclusión en Computación Científica) y fideicomisaria emérita de la Asociación de Python UK.
	
	
	Durante mi primer período:
	
	
	
		- Cofacilité discusiones estratégicas sobre la mejora y fortalecimiento de las iniciativas de la PSF destinadas a servir mejor a nuestra comunidad global.
		- Serví en el comité de PyCon US y en el equipo de Ejecución del Código de Conducta de PyCon US.
		- Respondí a los múltiples desafíos derivados de la pandemia global y su impacto en las iniciativas relacionadas con la PSF en torno a la concesión de subvenciones, financiamiento de proyectos y organización de eventos.
		- Trabajé estrechamente con la PSF para formalizar el estatus de PyLadies como patrocinado fiscal de la PSF. Esto nos permite apoyar mejor a la comunidad global de PyLadies, especialmente a los organizadores de capítulos globales.
		- Participé y facilité numerosas discusiones estratégicas con diversos grupos, mantenedores y usuarios de Python dentro de nuestra comunidad para entender cómo la PSF podría servir mejor a nuestra base de usuarios de Python en constante crecimiento. Gracias a esto, también pude guiar y co\-liderar la creación de un Grupo de Trabajo de la PSF enfocado en el éxito del usuario (que supervisará áreas de amplio alcance como accesibilidad, experiencia del usuario, incorporación de nuevos usuarios, usabilidad y descubribilidad de herramientas y recursos, e internacionalización y localización).
	Si soy elegida, me gustaría enfocarme en lo siguiente:
	
	
	**Continuar mejorando y fortaleciendo los programas e iniciativas de la PSF (por ejemplo, Subvenciones y procesos asociados, grupo de trabajo de D\&I)**
	
	
	Nuestra comunidad ha crecido y evolucionado significativamente a lo largo de los años. Durante mi período como directora, me he dado cuenta de que algunos de nuestros procesos e iniciativas necesitan mejoras para adaptarse a las diversas y cambiantes necesidades de nuestra comunidad. Factores externos, como cambios en la estabilidad general de la industria tecnológica y pandemias, también han impactado significativamente en nuestra comunidad y han tensado los procesos de apoyo y financiamiento que actualmente usamos. Quiero seguir trabajando con múltiples grupos de trabajo en toda la PSF e iterar/refinar procesos y mecanismos para empoderar a estos grupos y ayudar a la PSF a lograr su misión de fomentar el crecimiento de nuestra comunidad. También quiero ampliar los canales de retroalimentación y comunicación entre la comunidad y la PSF para asegurar que estos procesos estén anclados y guiados por las necesidades reales de nuestros miembros de la comunidad, nuevos miembros y líderes.
	
	
	**Continuar construyendo y fortaleciendo alianzas con comunidades hermanas, en particular, la Scientific Python**
	
	
	Una de mis prioridades es y seguirá siendo construir puentes entre comunidades interseccionales. Como alguien que viene del lado de la Computación Científica y PyData de la comunidad de Python, veo y aprecio la necesidad de construir puentes y crear espacios donde todos converjamos y tengamos discusiones sobre áreas estratégicas para toda la comunidad, como seguridad,, interoperabilidad, compatibilidad entre plataformas, accesibilidad y usabilidad, empaquetado y distribución, así como áreas emergentes y de tendencia como la IA y el Aprendizaje Automático.
	
	
	Seguiré encontrando formas de facilitar la creación de dichos espacios y hacer que sea más fácil financiar estos esfuerzos a través de vías como nuestro programa de desarrollador en residencia, asociaciones con la industria y otras actividades de financiamiento.
	
	
	**Trabajar para mejorar la experiencia del usuario y la accesibilidad de los recursos de la PSF y más allá.**
	
	
	La popularidad y el alcance de Python han crecido enormemente en los últimos años (y décadas, de hecho), y no hay señales de que esta tendencia disminuya en los próximos años. Sin embargo, se necesitan urgentemente varias mejoras en cuanto a recursos de incorporación directos y simplificados para los nuevos usuarios de Python, accesibilidad (para personas con discapacidades) y herramientas utilizables, sitios web, sitios de documentación y más. Quiero enfocarme en estas mejoras tan necesarias, definir mejor las rutas de éxito para los recién llegados al lenguaje y mejorar la experiencia del usuario de las herramientas y recursos de Python (principalmente como parte del Grupo de Trabajo de Éxito del Usuario).
	Además, me gustaría colaborar con los grupos de voluntarios de internacionalización y traducción existentes para proporcionar un mejor acceso a nuestra comunidad global y asegurar el apoyo adecuado para estos increíbles grupos de voluntarios.* **Nomination Statements**:

## [Greg Wilson](/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/greg-wilson/)




 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Greg Wilson
* **Previous Board Service**: New board member
* **Employer**: Plotly
* **Other Affiliations**: None
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	Python has been an important part of my life for a quarter of a century, so I would be grateful for a chance to serve its community as a member of the PSF board. I believe my experience has prepared me for doing so effectively: I co\-authored the PEP that added sets to the language, am a Fellow of the PSF, helped make Python the first\-year teaching language at Canada's largest university, and have written several books showing how to apply it to real\-world problems.
	
	
	I also launched and then led a non\-profit organization called Software Carpentry that now has thousands of instructors running workshops on basic computing skills in dozens of countries. Building that gave me first\-hand experience of the challenges that non\-profit organizations face; I hope that what I learned about fundraising, governance, community management, committee work, and managing changes in leadership will allow me to contribute to the PSF in meaningful ways.
	
	
	My other reason for nominating myself is that I don't like to leave things half\-done. The first generation of open source contributors proved that volunteers working together can create world\-class infrastructure and tools, but we are still struggling to make such work a viable career. Many people struggle to balance their desire to contribute with their need to pay their bills, while other simply burn out. If elected, I hope to help the PSF take the lead in tackling the sustainability crisis, and by doing so, help ensure that the Python community grows and thrives.




## [Karo Ladino](/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/karo-ladino/)




 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Karo Ladino
* **Previous Board Service**: New board member
* **Employer**: EXIT83
* **Other Affiliations**: PyLadies Colombia, PyLadies Bogotá, PyLadies Medellín, PyLadies Cali, Python Colombia, PyCon Colombia.
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	# Introduction
	
	
	Hello, I am Karo Ladino\-Puerto, also known as Karobot. I've been leading PyLadies Colombia since 2018, dedicating my time to organizing and coordinating events and sponsorships for Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali. My main goal is to increase the presence of women in the tech industry through various initiatives such as blogs, panels, activities, workshops, networking events, and collaborations with companies to facilitate women's entry into the tech sector. I've been a Python Software Foundation fellow since 2020\. Additionally, I founded a community for Product Management called "Mujeres y Producto" (in English: Women and Product), emphasizing that development, creation, and diversity in the digital world are essential not only from where we come from but also to where we are going.
	
	
	# Contributions to the Python Community
	
	
	Over the past few years, I've worked to empower women in the Python community. I've organized numerous events in various cities across Colombia, focusing on creating workshops and activities that foster learning and confidence in women's tech skills. Moreover, I've collaborated with companies to sponsor events and provide job opportunities for women, facilitating their entry into the tech industry. My commitment to the community extends through writing blogs and participating in panels that highlight the importance of diversity and inclusion in tech. I've been a keynote speaker at PyLATAM and PyCon Bolivia and have co\-organized PyCon Colombia since 2020\. Furthermore, I've given talks at PyDay Cali, PyDay Pereira, and many other Python events. I've also helped organize Django Girls Workshops, PyLadies events, and the Humble Data Workshop in Colombia and Mexico.
	
	
	# How I can contribute to the PSF Board
	
	
	With my experience leading PyLadies Colombia and my deep understanding of the needs and challenges women face in technology, I can bring a valuable perspective to the Board. I am committed to organizing and promoting initiatives encouraging women's participation in the Python community, including mentorship programs, specialized workshops, and networking events. Additionally, I've experience collaborating with companies and organizations to secure resources and support that benefit the community. Understanding the needs and challenges of people from Latin America, I can help the board create initiatives that address the unique aspects of our large and diverse community. I'm also pretty fun to be around 😅
	
	
	# Why I want to join the PSF Board
	
	
	My desire to join the PSF Board stems from my passion for promoting diversity and inclusion within the Python community. I aim to create an environment where women feel safe, supported, and valued. My goal is to increase women's confidence and presence in all aspects of Python development and maintenance, leveraging the visibility we have gained and working to overcome the challenges we still face. In addition to my efforts in organizing and creating spaces for sharing and growth, I want to expand my commitment to the Python community.
	I am a very detail\-oriented person who believes that, even in community work, we should always strive for the best possible outcomes. I believe in over\-communicating to ensure that everyone understands and feels understood. Communication is key to ensuring all parties are on the same page. I value reliability, empathy, and giving. I believe not everything requires a huge budget; it's more about the mindset and how we organize ourselves. At the end of the day, seeing the smiles of people in my community and knowing I've touched lives fulfills me.
	
	
	# Objectives as a Board Member
	
	
	As a member of the PSF Board, my objectives include:
	
	
	
		- Increasing the visibility and confidence of women in the Python community.
		- Promoting mentorship and professional development initiatives.
		- Working closely with other organizations to foster an inclusive and diverse environment.
		- Listening to multiple communities in as many languages as possible to understand what the Python community wants in the coming years and how the language is evolving. Based on current trends and information, I aim to identify the events, groups, and activities the Python Software Foundation can promote.
		- Helping document these processes and sharing outreach about what the Python Software Foundation does, contributing to content creation and information for everyone willing to engage in activities alongside the Foundation.
		Improving communications towards the Latin American audience, ensuring Spanish content is on par with English content. Also, helping other languages participate. Additionally, helping to define content strategies to increase awareness of initiatives, making them clearer and more impactful.
	# Conclusion
	
	
	I am committed to providing opportunities and support to the Python community, working to achieve greater diversity, equity, and inclusion. I firmly believe in creating environments where all individuals, regardless of their background, gender, or ability, have equal opportunities to participate and thrive. I am ready to take on this challenge and make a meaningful contribution to the growth and continued success of the Python community.* **Nomination Statements**:

## [Débora Azevedo](/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/debora-azevedo/)




 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Débora Azevedo
* **Previous Board Service**: PSF Board of Directors 2021\-2024 (3y term)
* **Employer**: Rio Grande do Norte state office of education
* **Other Affiliations**: PSF Diversity \& Inclusion workgroup, PyLadies Brazil
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	It's with great pleasure that I humbly submit my name for the 2024\-2027 term of the Python Software Foundation Board of Directors. Below, you'll find information about me, an overview of my Python Community contributions, and the goals that I have if elected
	
	
	## Who am I
	
	
	Hi!
	My name is Débora Azevedo and I've been a volunteer in the Python community for 10 years. As an active member of the Python community in Brazil, I co\-founded PyLadies Brazil, which is the network of PyLadies chapters in the country, the largest PyLadies chapter globally. Besides, I have been volunteering in the Python community, focusing on PyLadies, teaching Python, giving advice for community managers and organizing events.
	
	
	## Experience with the Python community and on the board
	
	
	I've been serving the PSF since 2020, even before I joined the board. I am an active participant of the Diversity and Inclusion workgroup, meeting quarterly and participating in events in panels.
	
	
	As a board director, for the past 3 years, I have attended about 85% of meetings, chaired a couple of them \- as my duty as vice chair states \- providing insights and points of discussion, focusing on getting the community closer to the PSF and empowering other fellow board members.
	
	
	While being part of the board, I acted most on D\&I duties, such as the sliding scale membership \- as a way to improve more participation from the community as supporting (and as a consequence voting) members of the PSF. I also took part in committees such as the executive committee (meeting before hand to organize and discuss agenda topics with chair, vice chair, treasurer and secretary) and PyCon US committee (as a board member in the insides of the organization of PyCon US, understanding its magnitude and discussing actions for the conference).
	
	
	Apart from that, I kept doing local/regional work, advising and helping community organizers to apply for grants, speaking at conferences and local meetups. 
	
	
	As I like to say, all this volunteer work takes much of our free time. This is the only resource we cannot take back, but I gladly spend some of it working on and for the Python community, which has allowed me to grow so much! We're investing our time to teach, advise and do outreach.

	## Goals as a board member
	
	
	As a member of the Board of Directors there are some goals I'd like to kick start and continue working on. All of it is deeply aligned with the core values that emerge from the work I've been doing over the past decade with the Python community in Brazil and worldwide.
	
	
	
		- Help the PSF to have stronger relations to community members by working on advertising and improving projects like the office hours (that exist now for grants and current board elections), getting input from the community on what are aspects they need more clarity from the PSF
		- Work directly on PSF materials internationalization and translation \- without materials like PSF membership documentation and registration forms available in multiple languages the PSF is not actively promoting inclusive practices for Pythonistas that aren't English proficient and/or English native speakers. This is but one example of items that can be targeted for translation, apart from Python documentation, which has been broadly translated (hooray!!).
		- Improve membership process with the newly created Membership committee, so we can have clearer membership types, updates on our members email lists and a smoother voting affirmation processes, empowering PSF members as they get closer to the foundation itself
		- Broaden the PSF's reach as an educational resource for Python in Education
	## Closing
	
	
	In closing, I would be honored to continue serving the Python community as a PSF Director. Quoting Brett Cannon, we come for the language but stay for the community. That's why I've been sticking around for all these years and intend to give it back to the very same community as I possibly can! I hope you will consider me a suitable candidate for this mission, to represent you and your community.* **Nomination Statements**:

It has been an honor to work with Debora on the Python Software Foundation Board. She has been thoughtful, strategic and empathetic with every action she takes supporting our community. I've seen the way that she raises her hand to support the language and the community around the language on the executive team, on the Diversity and Inclusion Work group, in PyCon planning and in her interpersonal relationships supporting our Python peers. Debora returning to the board to continue her work driving forward and increasing awareness for perspectives in the community, engaging thoughtfully in discussions and showing up to do the work that is not always glamorous or thanked would benefit the Python Community.

## [Ivy Fung](/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/ivy-fung/)




 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Ivy Fung
* **Previous Board Service**: \-
* **Employer**: HackQuest.io
* **Other Affiliations**: PyCon MY, PyCon APAC
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	I am **Ivy Fung** from Malaysia. Since 2019, I have been actively involved in organizing PyCon Malaysia. I volunteered to be the chairperson for PyCon APAC 2020 and had to face the challenge of turning the event around to be a virtual event in a short time. The following few years were a tough recovery period, just like all other PyCons were facing. Through these years, the PyCon MY team has learned valuable lessons, and I think the following 3 are the main learning I have:
	
	
	
		1. It is important to have support from other communities. We received support from PyCon communities and other communities around the world. I realized, that to receive help, others need to know that we exist and are active.
		2. We need to know who to reach out to. That means to actively participate in the communities.
		3. To know our vision and have the community in our hearts. That would drive us through the tough time.
	#### My Objectives in Running for the Board
	
	
	My experiences with Python communities past 5 years have encouraged me to step up to be for roles outside of Malaysia. There are 2 main objectives I am running for the board, and they are bilateral:
	
	
	
		1. **Stand up and be counted**. The Malaysian community has been around for more than 10 years and has been running PyCon MY annually without fail, no matter how tough the time was. To continue supporting the community, to have the community's voice to be heard is one of the factors. As PyCon MY is one of the active communities of the APAC region, our presence is not only about Malaysia, but a larger community, particularly South East Asia where presence in PSF needs improvement.
		2. **Communicating the goals of PSF**: I must admit that I know very little about the Python community in general for the first few years I have been organizing PyCon MY. I started actively to understand and share more about Python communities and participated in other PyCon and PyLadies events after I got to know more about it. The better way to be more involved is to help others to know more and to be more connected, and the best way is to be involved with upholding PSF’s vision and mission.
	#### My experiences and work\-in\-progress:
	
	
	
		- Organized PyCon MY since 2019
		- Chairperson for PyCon APAC 2020\. Successfully transitioned PyCon APAC 2020 to an online format due to the global pandemic. This event focused on panel discussions with speakers from different industries and communities to share their experiences and points of view.
		- Established connections with PyCon organizers regionally.
		- Volunteered for translation and emceeing at PyLadies events.
		- Actively participated and spoke in PyCons across the APAC region.
		- Aimed to make PyCon MY more sustainable
		- Groom successors.
		- Collaborated with local authorities and communities to promote PyCon MY.
	***\*******中文版******\******我是来自马来西亚的** Ivy Fung\*\*。自 2019 年以来，我一直积极参与筹办 PyCon Malaysia。我自愿担任 PyCon APAC 2020 的主席，并不得不面对在短时间内将活动转变为线上活动的挑战。接下来的几年是一段艰难的恢复期，就像所有其他 PyCon 所面临的一样。这些年来，PyCon MY 团队学到了宝贵的经验教训，我认为以下 3 点是我学到的重点：
	
	
	
		1. 获得其他社区的支持很重要。我们得到了 PyCon 社区和世界各地其他社区的支持。我意识到，要获得帮助，其他人需要知道我们的存在和并且保持社区的活跃。
		2. 我们需要知道该联系谁。这意味着要积极参与社区活动。
		3. 了解我们的愿景，以社区为的利益出发点。这愿景帮助我们度过艰难时期。
	#### 我竞选董事会的目标
	
	
	过去 5 年我在 Python 社区的经历鼓励我站出来担任马来西亚以外的职位。我竞选董事会有两个主要的双向目标：
	
	
	
		1. **站出来并被重视**。马来西亚社区已经存在了 10 多年。无论多么艰难，我门每年都坚持举办 PyCon MY，从未间断。继续支持社区，让社区的声音被听到是其中一个因素。由于 PyCon MY 是亚太地区活跃的社区之一，我们的存在不仅针对马来西亚，还针对更大的社区，特别是东南亚，PyCon MY 在PSF 中的存在需要加强。
		2. **传达 PSF 的目标**：我必须承认，在筹办 PyCon MY 的最初几年里，我对 PyCon MY 以外社区的了解甚少。在对 Python 社区有了更多了解之后，我开始积极地了解和分享更多关于 Python 社区的信息，并参加了其他 PyCon 和 PyLadies 活动。我觉得，参与的更好方法是帮助其他人了解更多并建立更多联系，最好的方法是参与维护 PSF 的愿景和使命。
	我的经历和正在进行的工作：
	自 2019 年起组织 PyCon MY
	PyCon APAC 2020 主席。由于全球疫情，成功将 PyCon APAC 2020 转变为线上形式。本次活动以小组讨论为主，来自不同行业和社区的演讲者分享他们的经验和观点。
	与地区 PyCon 组织者建立联系。
	在 PyLadies 活动中担任翻译和主持志愿者。
	积极参与亚太地区 PyCon 并发表演讲。
	旨在让 PyC​​on MY 更具可持续性
	培养继任者。
	与当地政府和社区合作推广 PyCon MY。* **Nomination Statements**:

 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Anna Astori
* **Previous Board Service**: New board member
* **Employer**: Cigna Group
* **Other Affiliations**: Python Boston, PyLadies Boston, Django Djangonaut
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	Introduction
	
	
	Hello, my name is Anna Astori. My academic journey began with a passion for linguistics, where I delved into the complexities of human language, its structures, and its nuances. However, in my free time, I absolutely enjoyed developing my first programs in Turbo Pascal on an IBM\-386—yes, it was a while ago! These two passions led me to explore the intersections between language and technology, prompting my transition into computational linguistics and artificial intelligence through my master's program at Brandeis University. Since then, I have worked for several AI and data science\-focused organizations, where I gained vast experience and an in\-depth understanding of both the scientific underpinnings and practical implementations of AI technologies developed in Python.
	
	
	Contributions to the Python Community
	
	
	For a number of years, my Python journey has been driven by my commitment to community engagement, knowledge sharing, and mentorship. Among the activities I am engaged in are the following:
	
	
	● I maintain a blog where I share tutorials, insights, and experiences related to Python programming. I hope that this platform serves as a resource for developers at all levels for continuous learning and exploration.
	
	
	● I speak at meetups and podcasts, discussing Python trends, challenges, and opportunities, thereby reaching a broader audience and advocating for the language’s benefits and potential.
	
	
	● I have volunteered as a technical reviewer for several Python programming books. This role has allowed me to contribute to the community’s educational resources.
	
	
	● I volunteered as a judge for one of the Women Who Code (WWC) hackathons as a Python expert.
	
	
	● My role on the review committee for one of the WWC conferences has enabled me to ensure that the conference's Python\-related content is relevant, engaging, and of the highest quality.
	
	
	● At one of my workplaces, I also mentored non\-technical employees, guiding them in their transition into a tech career and helping them hone their Python programming skills.
	
	
	● As a member of the Django’s Djangonaut program, I have started contributing to the Django framework.
	
	
	● My co\-organizer, Fay Shaw, and I have revived PyLadies Boston.
	
	
	I am particularly passionate about Python and community engagement, which inspires me to continuously contribute to the advancement of Python as a leading programming language across multiple domains.
	
	
	Objectives as a Board Member
	
	
	Leveraging my two years of experience as WWC Boston Director, one of my objectives is to promote DEI in the Python community and ensure overall thriving community engagement. This experience has also equipped me to work on marketing and fundraising campaigns and grant application procedures.
	 On the other hand, leveraging my seven years of industry experience and deep domain knowledge, I would also like to focus on infrastructure and packaging improvements, as well as the overall advancement of Python as a go\-to programming language in the scientific community.




## [Filipe Laíns](/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/filipe-lains/)




 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Filipe Laíns
* **Previous Board Service**: New board member
* **Employer**: Quansight Labs
* **Other Affiliations**: Python Core Developer, Python Packaging Authority (member), PSF (contributing member), Arch Linux (package maintainer), pyOpenSci (maintainer)
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	# Introduction 👋
	
	
	Hi everyone! My name is Filipe Laíns (they/them or he/him), and I am a self\-taught developer from Portugal. I really enjoy tinkering with things and understanding how they work, which is how I got started with programming. My hobbies include electronics, physics, and culture. A lot of my time away from the computer is spent traveling and watching live shows.
	
	
	##### Feel free to jump to the goals section if you don't have much time to look at my background and motivation!
	
	
	# Experience 🐍
	
	
	I have a deep technical background in both Python, and Linux packaging, and am currently employed at [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/), where I work on Python packaging. I am also a Python core developer and an active contributor to Scientific Python ecosystem.
	
	
	Here are some relevant key points of my experience:
	
	
	
		- [Python core](https://github.com/python/cpython)
		- In the standard library, I mainly focus on [`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html) and [`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html).
		- Maintainer of [`importlib_resources`](https://github.com/python/importlib_resources) and [`importlib_metadata`](https://github.com/python/importlib_metadata).
		- [Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)](https://github.com/pypa)
		- Author and maintainer of [`pypa/build`](https://github.com/pypa/build) and [`pypa/pyproject-metadata`](https://github.com/pypa/pyproject-metadata).
		- Maintainer of [`distutils`](https://github.com/pypa/distutils) (base codebase for [`setuptools`](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools)).
		- Organization triager (*Gardener*).
		- [Python Packaging Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org)
		- Organization triager (*Gardener*).
		- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)
		- Packager for over 6 years, and currently maintain over [250 packages](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=FFY00&flagged=).
		- [meson\-python](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python)
		- Original author and did most of the initial work.
			* This allowed to move [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), etc. away from [`distutils`](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/distutils.html).
		- [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org)
		- Maintainer.
		- [Conda](https://github.com/conda/conda)
		- Contributor.
	You can find more details about my technical work on my [website](https://ffy00.github.io/) and [Github profile](https://github.com/FFY00).
	
	
	As part of my work, I have also done a lot of outreach onto to many different parts of the Python community. The goal being to make sure they are heard and their concerns are taken into account during packaging and [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) development.
	
	
	On top of my technical background, I also have experience in community building and am an active member of the community.
	
	
	
		- [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org)
		- Organizer of the [Packaging Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/packaging-summit/) at PyCon US for 2 years.
			* This has given me invaluable insight into the particular issues of users.
		- Mentor for the [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) project on the [Mentored Sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/mentored-sprints/) for 2 years.
		- Sprinted on multiple projects, such as [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) and [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org).
		- Conference volunteer for 2 years.
		- [PyCon Portugal](https://pycon.pt)
		- Presented the [*Getting started with (modern) Python packaging*](https://2023.pycon.pt/talks/schedule/schedule/pycon-pt-2023/talk/UVAQW3/index.html) talk in 2023\.
	Outside Python, I have been volunteering and helping organize several local community events for many years, with a focus on culture, music, etc.
	
	
	# Motivation 💭
	
	
	I am very passionate about the Python community and want to make sure everyone feels heard, included, and have the resources they need.
	
	
	One thing in particular I want to advocate for is a better user and developer experience. I believe this can be achieved by combining more outreach into Python communities and placing more resources on the Python packaging ecosystem. Seeing the work of the current board on supporting the Python core team, I am confident similar strides can be made on the Python user experience — particularly the *new user* experience — by putting resources into it.
	
	
	From my experience, both on the technical side and my outreach work, UX and packaging are critical areas that haven't been receiving much funding or attention. I believe the PSF can make a big impact on this, and that's what I want to advocate for. Over the years I have talked with many users about their frustrations, difficulties, and overall experiences in using Python for a wide variety of applications, so I feel strongly about my ability to advocate for them.
	
	
	# Goals 🎯
	
	
	
		- Improve the user experience for new users, lowering the barrier of entry to Python, and programming in general.
			* E.g. Improve the process of getting started with Python, by improving the documentation, SEO, user experience (UX) consistency, binary distribution methods, etc.
		- Support the Python packaging community by providing them with the resources needed to achieve a better and more cohesive user experience.
			* E.g. Fund user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX) research and technical viability discovery work.
		- Engage with external stakeholders (e.g. distributors), as needed, in order to ensure the integrity of the Python distribution. This contributes to the two goals listed above.
		- Continue the PSF's work on supporting the Python core team, ensuring the longevity of the language.
		- Encourage collaboration between the various different Python communities and user groups, making sure everyone feels part of, and represented, in the Python community.
			* E.g. Reach out to user groups, and event organizers, for feedback more often. Create bridges between different parts of the community. etc.
		- Create a better path of discussion between the technical teams and the end users, by trying to incorporate feedback from user groups into the technical decision/design process.
			* E.g. Invest in user\-advocacy work. Reach out to user groups and create and ask for UX and DX feedback. Have people who are skilled in UX and have some technical background act as bridges between users and technical stakeholders. etc.* **Nomination Statements**:

It's been a pleasure getting to know Filipe over the past few years. Our discussions over the health of the Python community have been thoughtful and much appreciated in my time on the board. Filipe has a perspective on the Python ecosystem, lowering barriers to entry and creating patterns that reduce friction, that transcends to the people in the community. 


I am confident that Filipe is a volunteer that takes care to research and understand the human systems supporting the Python language, identify potential points where the community could benefit from thoughtful and empathetic effort, listen to outside perspectives and then drive forward actions keeping in mind members needs over ego. I would be happy to work with them on the Python Software Foundation Board.


We've specifically had conversations about packaging in the Scientific Python context, safety at Python events, programs that support the sustainability of Python projects and creating pathways for new developers.






***Nomination by***: Cristián Maureira\-Fredes
 

I have known Filipe for a couple of years, and I was very surprised since the beginning by the amount of community work he has been doing in the many communities he has been involved in.


Having a community driven personality and a technical background that's supported by his roles as CPython core developer and member of the PyPA, I believe he will keep improving the communication between those entities and the PSF Board.


With a person focused on packaging and user experience in the board, I believe the scope of the board of directors will be improved, and they could manage to open a few research positions to improve the UX and DX aspects of Python.


On a personal level, he is a very kind person, and I believe that his personality will not disturb the current board, and will find ways to position his opinion without generating disruptions.






***Nomination by***: 
 

With enthusiasm, I nominate Filipe Lains for the PSF board. I admire the work that Filipe has done in the Python community. They are a devoted Python core developer and also have been involved in leading the packaging summit for the past few years at PyCon US \- a really important and challenging area that needs more support from people like Filipe. Filipe also cares a lot about the community and some of the usability issues that are particularly challenging those newer to Python. These issues are exactly the type of things that we need people to stand up for on the PSF board. Filipe also cares about the community. Most recently Filipe has become more involved in pyOpenSci \- an organization that is bridging the gap between the scientific Python community and the greater Python community particularly in the package area.

Unfortunately, due to the situation in Iran, we do not have the same level of international activity or communication as communities in European countries. We aim to change this for the sake of knowledge and experience sharing. You can view my contributions on the Python Wiki.
	
	
	My daily work involves using Python, and I have hosted numerous talks, meetups, and workshops aimed at empowering non\-programmers, such as non\-CS students, professionals in finance and accounting, and mechanical engineers, to use Python for automating repetitive tasks. These efforts not only expand the reach of Python but also equip individuals with valuable skills.
	
	
	In addition to my technical contributions, I have actively worked to expand the Python community in regions with limited access to technology. I have led initiatives to introduce Python programming to underserved populations, providing them with the tools and knowledge to improve their career prospects. This includes organizing educational events and setting up community support systems in areas with poor internet access.
	
	
	 ***Statement of Concerns*** 
	
	
	My primary motivation for seeking a position on the PSF Board of Directors is to bring attention to the challenges faced by underrepresented and underserved communities within the Python ecosystem. 
	
	
	
		1. **Access to Education**: There are significant barriers to education for girls in Afghanistan. The denial of educational opportunities for these girls is a grave concern that needs to be addressed.
		2. **Internet Access**: In countries like Iran, many people do not have reliable internet access due to both technical limitations and wide censorship, which severely limits their ability to learn and contribute to the Python community. The PSF can work with PyPI mirror providers to improve access in the MENA region, provide more offline shareable materials in local languages, and support local Python groups that may need OFAC licenses, making these accessible with the help of the PSF.
		3. **Support for Persian\-speaking Communities**: There is a notable absence of PyLadies chapters and Python support for Persian\-speaking girls in Iran, Afghanistan, and other Persian\-speaking countries.
		4. **Community Building in Arabic\-speaking Countries**: Even in relatively stable countries like Oman, there is a lack of a strong Python community, which I believe is partly due to cultural barriers.
	 ***Commitment to Advocacy*** 
	
	
	My candidacy is driven by a commitment to tell the stories of these underserved communities. It is not about whether I am elected or not; what is important is that the voices of these communities are heard. I want to highlight the impact that strong, inclusive communities can have in enabling individuals to find new opportunities and overcome societal barriers.
	
	
	 ***Conclusion*** 
	
	
	I am excited about the possibility of serving on the PSF Board of Directors and contributing to the Foundation’s efforts to create a more inclusive and supportive Python community. Thank you for considering my nomination.

## [KwonHan Bae](/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/kwonhan-bae/)




 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: KwonHan Bae
* **Previous Board Service**: 2023
* **Employer**: LINE Plus Corporation
* **Other Affiliations**: Python User Group of Korea, PyCon KR, PyCon APAC, PSF Conduct WG
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	# One Year is Too Short
	
	
	One year is too short. Over the past year, I have learned a great deal from the PSF, and I would like the opportunity to contribute more to the community with this valuable experience.
	
	
	# What I Learned as PSF Board Member
	
	
	Through my efforts to connect within the Asian region where I reside, I've come to realize something important. Not only in Asia but also in Africa and other regions, there are many talented individuals with the potential to contribute to the Python ecosystem. However, due to lack of connections or information, we are not collaborating with these individuals. I aim to strengthen and expand these unconnected areas.
	
	
	My involvement with the PSF's Conduct Working Group has taught me a great deal and clarified what we need to do. We have learned what aspects we need to consider and maintain to connect more and be more inclusive of a wider range of people. This is crucial for the growth and development of our community.
	
	
	# My Vision and Experience for Python Community Growth
	
	
	First and foremost, I believe in the importance of community\-based contributors, as opposed to only major library or core developers. While technical contributions are undeniably crucial, I firmly believe that a thriving, diverse, and inclusive community is equally important for the sustained growth and influence of Python worldwide.
	
	
	For over a decade, I have fostered such a community in Korea. My work has involved founding and leading a Python user group, thereby creating a solid platform for Python enthusiasts to share knowledge, collaborate, and grow together.
	
	
	My commitment to the Python community was exemplified when I delivered a lightning talk at PyCon US 2023\. The talk provided a comprehensive overview of my vision and work. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54q_cPCNNS8&t=172s)
	
	
	When creating PyCon Korea, I was fortunate to receive significant support and guidance from friends in Japan and Taiwan, which was instrumental in the success of the initiative. This experience of international collaboration not only strengthened our local community but also enriched my understanding of community building. I am now able to pay this forward, using the insights and experiences gained to assist friends in other countries to develop their Python communities.
	
	
	In my professional capacity, I am currently employed at LINEYAHOO, a major messaging company based in Japan. Although the company primarily uses Java for application development, I, as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), strive to utilize Python in developing and managing the company's infrastructure. Further, I am actively encouraging developers within the company to adopt Python and participate in the wider Python community. This work reflects my belief in the value Python can bring to any organization and my commitment to its growth.
	
	
	Through the organization of user meetups, I have been instrumental in establishing community standards and propagating concepts such as the Code of Conduct. This model has since been adopted by various IT communities across Korea, with many looking to PyCon Korea as a standard of Community Driven IT Conference.
	
	
	My community\-building efforts also extend to the international stage, where I have been part of the organization of PyCon APAC. Collaborating with teams across the region has granted me a broader perspective on the diverse needs and potential of the Python community in the Asia Pacific.
	
	
	Having led PyCon Korea for nine years, I am currently working on transitioning leadership to the next generation, a process that has further honed my skills in cultivating leadership and ensuring the sustainability of community initiatives.
	
	
	In conclusion, my experience and commitment to the Python community, both locally and internationally, equip me well for the Director position within the PSF. I am eager to leverage my passion for community building and my leadership experience to contribute to the Python Software Foundation at this higher level.
	
	
	Thank you for considering my nomination. I look forward to the possibility of serving the Python community in this capacity.* **Nomination Statements**:

***Nomination by***: Dong\-hee Na
 

In short, one year was too short for him, let's give him more activity chances!


Since last year, Kwonhan has contributed in various ways to the APAC Python community by participating in PyCon US, APAC, and KR.
His activity improves the Asia community compared to last year by actively encouraging Asian community members to participate in Python community activities worldwide. Kwonhan always tries to listen to what Asia community members need and connect with the people who can help!
Lastly, he is working for one of the big tech companies in Asia, so I believe he can be a good bridge for the needs of underrepresented regions, not only from a community perspective but also from a technical perspective.


Let's give him 3 years more :)






***Nomination by***: Younggun Kim
 

I have known KwonHan for many years, dating back to when we co\-founded PyCon Korea. Our long\-standing relationship has given me a unique insight into his character, capabilities, and dedication to the community which makes me feel compelled to share my thoughts on his potential contribution.


In his current role, KwonHan is undertaking what he describes as a crucial mission. His focus extends beyond Korea, encompassing efforts to revitalize our communities across Asia. It's an ambitious undertaking, one that KwonHan assures will require enough time and resources to yield tangible results. I am convinced that KwonHan possesses both the commitment and the skills to see it through to fruition.


While the results of his efforts may not be immediately visible, I am confident that given more time, KwonHan will achieve remarkable outcomes. It is precisely for this reason that I recommend him for the board.






***Nomination by***: Denny Perez
 

I would like to nominate KwonHan Bae for the PSF Board of Directors. KwonHan has made significant contributions to the global Python community. I first met KwonHan on the board of directors and had the opportunity to work with him. During this time, I have seen his great sense of collaboration and dedication. Although he has only had one year on the board, he has shown immense potential and commitment, which is why he deserves to continue as a director.


KwonHan co\-founded PyCon KR and has been running it for about 10 years. He has also led the Python User Group Korea for over a decade, fostering a strong community of Python developers in the region. KwonHan has been instrumental in mentoring and creating new Python user groups in Korea, including PyLadies Seoul and HelloPy.


As a member of the PyCon APAC Committee, KwonHan has helped regional PyCons in the Asia\-Pacific region for about 10 years. He has given numerous talks about Python, Django, MicroPython, and Pytest, sharing his knowledge and expertise widely.


In his one year serving on the PSF Board, KwonHan has learned a lot and is eager to continue contributing. He has also served on the PSF Conduct Working Group, showing his dedication to maintaining a positive and inclusive community.


We need as much global representation as we can get on the PSF board, and I believe KwonHan will serve as a strong voice for the Korean and broader APAC Python communities. I gladly will be casting my vote for him during this election.






***Nomination by***: Cristián Maureira\-Fredes
 

I met KwonHan Bae during PyConUS2024 after he gave his lightning talk about 1\-year as a PSF Board Directory, and I quickly noticed that most of the ideas he had for the PSF were aligned with the ones I had.


Briefly, I have collaborated with him on the search for mechanisms from the PSF to enable more Translation teams to be motivated to participate, but also on a separate discussion he was very open to new suggestions. When I approached him to invite him to gather information of people that deserves to be a PSF fellow but wasn't already, he accepted right away.


I would like KwonHanBae to continue in his current role at the PSF Board of directors, because I believe he can achieve great things not only with the Korean and Asian communities, but globally.






***Nomination by***: Iqbal Abdullah
 

I am nominating Kwon Han for a seat on the PSF board.


Kwon\-Han has been and still is a driving force in community organizing in KR and APAC. Has has put in a lot of effort to increase diversity within the East and SE Asia region, not only within nationality perspective but also gender.


Using his platform as a current board member of the PSF, he has promoted PSF membership and also understanding of the role of the PSF. We still need Kwon\-Han to be on the board.






***Nomination by***: Joeun Park
 

KwonHan Bae initiated PyCon Korea and has contributed to its continuation for over ten years. In a Python community where female developers are a minority, he has supported and mentored numerous women, helping them become conference speakers and open source contributors for more than a decade. Thanks to his efforts, I have also had the opportunity to present at various Python\-related conferences and seminars and received mentoring for my presentations.


To encourage participation in diverse areas of Python, he has organized and supported monthly or quarterly Python\-related conferences, seminars, mentoring sessions, and study events for the past ten years.


Additionally, he has consistently provided significant assistance to those seeking to expand their careers through Python for over a decade.






***Nomination by***: Ivy Fung
 

I would like to nominate KwonHan Bae from PyCon KR because he is very supportive to the whole PyCon community. He is very encouraging and supportive, sharing with me ideas and tips in running the community. 


He has:
\- Co\-Found PyCon KR, run it for about 10 years
\- Run Python User Group Korea over 10 years
\- Mentoring Create Python User Groups in Korea ( pyladies Seoul, and hellopy now )
\- PyCon APAC Committee to help regional pycon in apac about 10 years
 did speech about python itself, django, micropython, pytest over 50 times. 
\- Personal Mentoring young pythonista ( currently 1 person, mentored over 30 people )






***Nomination by***: 
 

I have observed his activities for a long time. He has been very active in the Python community and the F/OSS community in South Korea. He has especially dedicated himself to organizing and running PyCon Korea for a long time.


Additionally, he has worked to support women developers and is actively involved in efforts to eliminate discrimination (including gender discrimination) within the community.


Like the rest of the world, South Korea is still flooded with toxic speech and expensive bootcamps that cannot guarantee quality. Amidst this, he spares no effort in protecting and guiding socially disadvantaged individuals and beginners who are interested in software engineering in the right direction.


Most people, including myself, believe they are just, but they do not take active steps. However, he does.

 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Darrell Jenkins
* **Previous Board Service**: New Board Member
* **Employer**: 1st Security Bank
* **Other Affiliations**: PuPPy (Puget Sound Programming Python)
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	# Introduction
	
	
	*Location:* Washington State, USA
	
	
	My love for programming began in childhood from when the Commodore 64 was a thing, to experimenting with BASIC and Pascal. After living a diverse life full of other interests, I jumped headfirst into Python in July 2023\. I absolutely love the Python programming language and the community around it! The PyCascades 2024 sessions were incredible, and I am so grateful that I was in a position to attend in person. 
	
	
	More importantly, I firmly believe that my service to the Python Software Foundation would bring a unique perspective and set of capabilities that would be of great value to the Python community. Commitment to something so important as this requires the ability to see projects through to completion and knowing when to pivot or adjust course. It involves recognizing the value and strength of the team effort which includes not only the Board, but the entire Python community. 
	
	
	# Community Contributions
	
	
	Although the PuPPy (Puget Sound Programming Python) monthly meetings are a good 2\.5\-hour drive away from my location, I have strived to be actively involved both in person and via Slack. In fact, I had the privilege of giving an in person lightning talk in April 2024\. My theme was “Learning How to Learn Python” (https://youtu.be/lJsTeBwhBGg?si\=PK8eQsV4mmKV7PzB). The best part of that experience was being able to help newcomers feel understood, and also making so many connections in the Python community. Between October 2023 and March 2024, I volunteered with West Sound CoderDojo in Silverdale, WA helping kids and their parents find a welcoming, helpful local venue to celebrate coding. Outside of Python, I participate as a member of the Clallam County Economic Development Council and the North Olympic Development Council.
	
	
	Most notably, in 2023 I began reflecting on how to better serve local business owners. People needed a place to gather that did not require membership fees but still had value. So in June 2023 I Co\-Founded the *It’s All About YOU – Business Networking Group*. It provides a platform where people can meet and share what makes them successful, and also share challenges they have. Our one\-hour meetings are designed to provide brief practical educational segments (like fraud prevention), feature a local nonprofit guest speaker, and then the remaining time is for everyone to interact with each other. The program has been well received and I hope to expand it into additional regions.
	
	
	# Background
	
	
	I grew up in a town that hosted people of all backgrounds and I love getting to know people of all diversities. I am a pianist and published popular science author. My book *First Light and Beyond – Making a Success of Astronomical Observing* was published in 2015 by Springer as part of the Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series. As a commercial banker in my local community, I help educate business owners on how they can gain access to valuable resources to help their businesses thrive. The best part is seeing their business grow after I help them acquire those resources. These combined aspects of my background will help serve the PSF and the community by offering creativity, advanced writing skills, and a solid financial framework. Having experienced entry into Python myself over the last 10 months or so would also help me to serve the PSF as an authentic voice and advocate for newcomers to the Python language and its community.
	
	
	# Objectives
	
	
	*The following are just a few ideas that I believe would be helpful to the Python community if I were to serve as a PSF board member.*
	
	
	*Communication:* Communication is not simply the belief that we have delivered information to the recipient. It involves a mutual understanding that real communication and a beneficial exchange of ideas has taken place. I want to help make that happen. Additionally, we need cross pollination, not only between the PSF and Core Developers to Python enthusiasts, but also between the PSF to Core Developers. The community would also love to hear more often from both the PSF and Core Developers in various ways that are truly accessible.
	
	
	*Transparency:* It’s important that people who are passionate about Python and its community better understand the processes, procedures, and challenges that are normally behind the scenes. While excess details are not needed, a more open look at Python’s key people (and their activities) can be helpful to inspire greater participation while helping mold Python’s innovators and leaders of tomorrow.
	
	
	*Education:* After spending 10 years teaching piano to children and adults, I am passionate about education. I believe that we can do so much more to promote education around the Python language which will not only benefit the Python ecosystem but also help bring people together. Strong communities are the glue of humanity. Better training for volunteers and staff for Python’s annual events will also benefit everyone by extending the already inclusive environment to be more welcoming, encouraging, and engaging.
	
	
	# Summary
	
	
	I am a professional, experienced candidate who brings a unique perspective to what it means to support the Python community.

 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Cristián Maureira\-Fredes
* **Previous Board Service**: New board member
* **Employer**: The Qt Company
* **Other Affiliations**: Python en Español, PyLadies Berlin, Python Chile, Python Spain
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	# Statement
	
	
	## Introduction
	
	
	My name is Cristián and I'm currently a Team Lead and Developer at The Qt Company,
	working mainly on the Qt for Python project, which is the official set of Python bindings
	for the Qt Project, which is written in C\+\+.
	I'm originally from Chile 🇨🇱, but I have been living for the past 11 years in Germany 🇩🇪.
	
	
	I have been around to Python since 2009, while I was studying Computer Science back in my country.
	Afterward during my further studies, I used Python and C\+\+ both for my Masters and Doctorate.
	So in a nutshell, Python has been around during my whole student/professional life.
	
	
	Around 2019 I decided to try and join a few Python events to see if it was a nice thing to do during my spare time,
	And since then I haven't stopped.
	My **involvement in communities and initiatives** (see last section) led me to join also conference
	organization teams as well, including PyConUS and EuroPython.
	
	
	I'm a hands\-on person, that not only has ideas, but prefer to present tangible proof of concepts in order to improve
	processes and initiatives.
	
	
	My nomination goals are:
	
	
	
		- Maintain and improve the transparency
		- Improve communication and resources
		- Helping invisible communities and fellowship
		- Advocacy for PyCons and PyLadies
	that you can read in the following sections.
	
	
	## Qualifications and Experience
	
	
	After being involved in many **communities**, i have the feeling that I will be a **good fit to join the board dynamics** in order to contribute to all the active initiatives.
	
	
	My experience from **conferences** will make me able to **react quickly** when problem arises, and do my best to have a friendly environment.
	
	
	And my **professional experience** will help me acquiring **stakeholders requirements** in order to find solutions that can improve the participation of people in the Python community but also having in consideration my **technical background**, I can easily approach conversation that involves CPython and Python development.
	
	
	You can read more about the initiatives I actively contribute in the final section of this statement.
	
	
	## Goals
	
	
	I want changes.
	My main goal is not to be around and keep doing what everyone is doing in the board,
	but to push for new ways of bringing more people to the PSF, by improving the way we
	communicate, and present our resources and initiatives.
	
	
	### Maintain and improve the transparency
	
	
	The PSF board does a lot of things, do you know which ones?
	If the answer is no, you can quickly jump to /psf/records/board/minutes/
	where you can discover that most of the members provide monthly reports of their activities.
	I want every PSF member to be aware of those reports, so they can check the progress
	of everyone behind the board.
	
	
	I firmly believe that having official channels where those reports are shared,
	and even more important, to keep track of the individual goals that people promised in their
	nominations is crucial to keep people posted.
	Personally, I adopted a format of [daily logs of my contributions](https://github.com/cmaureir/community-work)
	that I will keep around for my own Board duties.
	
	
	There are other processes that the PSF is in charge as well,
	that as long as there is information that can be public, we could communicate and highlight how did it happen,
	like the recent hires for PyPI, PSF staff, etc, so people can be closer to our decisions.
	The same with the grants, I believe the board can be transparent on recommendations for good practices
	while requesting grants, sharing at the same time negative points that some might have, so people is able to improve their
	applications.
	
	
	### Improve communication and resources
	
	
	The resources we have under [https://python.org/psf\-landing](/psf-landing/) are essential
	to the participation of more people in the PSF for the working groups, join as members, apply for grants, etc.
	However, the way the information is presented can be improved in order to be a proper resource hub.
	
	
	I would like to migrate the content to a documentation\-focused web that can be better indexed,
	easy to navigate, and that people can contribute to, specially with their translations.
	The PSF website needs to be an example of i18n and a10y, and our resources needs to be presented
	in a way that anyone can find any topic when needed.
	
	
	Similarly, we need to document our [working groups](/psf/workgroups/#grants-work-group)
	processes publicly (when possible) so people can suggest improvements, or even mimic what we do.
	Providing information about the working groups on the same page is essential to improve the participation
	from new faces.
	
	
	There has been lots of work on https://psfmember.org which is great, so I believe a proper
	resources/docs web for the PSF will complement that functionality perfectly.
	
	
	### Helping invisible communities and fellowship
	
	
	For me, an invisible community is one that is formed by people that has been working through the years
	that most people is not aware of, that have no PSF fellows around, and no participation in big projects.
	Those communities are the key for the evolution of the PSF, and we need to nurture them, and do our
	best in order to recognize their work.
	
	
	Similarly, I'm aware of many communities that try to get PSF grants and have failed so far.
	Like I stated before, I would like to help them to get PSF help, not only to increase the percentage
	of grants we give to countries in other continents, but to let them know that it's in our full
	interest that they do get our support and they are important for us.
	
	
	I know organizers from **South America, Central America, Africa and Asia** that will be very happy
	if such initiative's scope could reach them out.
	
	
	During PyConUS 2024 I started an initiative with two active board members, to start gathering names
	of people that have been doing lots of the Python community and are not yet PSF Fellows,
	so we could promote them and enable them to keep looking for others that needs to be recognized
	
	
	### Advocacy for PyCons and PyLadies
	
	
	Due to my contributions to different PyCon and PyLadies initiatives, I will be actively contacting
	organizers to provide the most feedback and support I can in order to improve their dynamics,
	engagement, and organization.
	
	
	I want to actively help the Global PyLadies Council to grow even further, by being around and being
	available to listen to any issue that might require the help from the board, and I believe my
	experience from PyLadies Berlin and PyLadiesCon has helped me understand how to support this
	amazing organization.
	
	
	### Final words
	
	
	I know there are a **lots of things to be done**, and many hours per weeks needs to be used in order
	to make real progress, so part of my plan is to focus my attention to my PSF Board duties, delegating
	my other responsibilities to other community members, so I can have enough time for this new role.
	
	
	As any nomination, some of the goals might be impossible to achieve, but I want to ensure you I will
	do my best to fulfill them all, and if somethings falls down, I will provide you with the reasoning
	behind I couldn't achieve what I stated here.

***Nomination by***: Dawn Wages
 

Cristian has been an active member of the Python community for a long time. I'm so lucky to have grown from our Python conversations as we have met at this event or that. His kindness and intention are the first to greet you, then his earnest and engaged advocacy of the most marginalized in Python. He brings ideas forward that are thoughtful, pragmatic and well\-informed with activities to drive them forward. 


His advocacy of the Spanish speaking Python community is long standing. From his work in translations, PyCon Charlas, Hacktoberfest, and Spanish Python events; his passion for lowering barriers for a community that has historically gone without programming resources is impressive and authentic. It doesn't stop there; in our discussions about changes to the Python website, representation on the Python board, ways that the Python Software Foundation can engage with the community and how we as Python community members can engage with each other starts locally and acts globally to improve Python every day. 


I would be thrilled to serve on the Python Software Foundation board with him.

 Nomination details
 

* **Name**: Barbara Shaurette
* **Previous Board Service**: n/a
* **Employer**: Vox Media LLC
* **Other Affiliations**: PSF, PyLadies
* **Nominee Statement**:
	
	My name is Barbara Shaurette, and I’m running for a seat on the board of the Python Software Foundation. 
	
	
	Why am I qualified to join the PSF board? I know the community well. I’ve been an active member of the Python community for almost 20 years \- less so in the past five because of a serious illness, but I’m finally returning to organizing and teaching this year, and I’ve stayed involved remotely during that time.
	
	
	I’ve worked as a Python (and sometimes Django) developer for most of that 20 years, almost all of it building applications and working with data in the media/journalism space. These days, I work as an SRE for Vox Media, putting my Python skills to work writing tools to help manage our infrastructure.
	
	
	I’ve been a PyLadies member and organizer since 2012\. I co\-founded PyLadies Austin and ran that group for its first year, heading up workshops and educational events. I also have extensive experience with teaching \- from 2013 through 2017, I organized and taught the Young Coders workshops at PyCon US and at regional conferences around the United States. I’ve taught Python workshops aimed at beginners in Portland and Austin, and in 2015 I was a DjangoGirls organizer and coach in Austin. In 2017, I was honored to receive the Frank Willison Memorial Award for my contributions to Python education. I also spoke at the UN in 2016! (I’m only half\-joking \- that year, PyGotham was actually held at the United Nations and I gave a talk about Python pedagogy and organizing classes.)
	
	
	Why am I running? Because I care about the community that’s given so much back to me, and I want to see all of its members succeed. I’ve been advocating for women in programming throughout my career, but I know that creating equity is bigger than that. I’m a politically active person with strong opinions, but I am also dedicated to listening to what people need.
	
	
	I want to make sure the PSF builds on its legacy of supporting marginalized groups and expands its programs supporting them, through grants, education, communication and whatever other tools we have at hand. And I want new members of the community \- new attendees at conferences, new contributors to Python libraries, new students learning Python \- to feel as welcome as I did the first time I went to a Python conference. It’s the reason I’m still here many years later.

I am deeply committed to growing the Python user base, particularly in underrepresented regions, and I would bring this same dedication to the PSF Board.
	
	
	In addition to my community leadership experience, I am also an accomplished Python programmer with a track record of innovative problem\-solving. I have contributed to several widely adopted open\-source packages, and I have a history of identifying pain points within the community and spearheading creative solutions. On the PSF Board, I would leverage this technical expertise to provide valuable insights and help address the evolving needs of Python users worldwide.
	
	
	Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values that I have championed throughout my involvement in the Python community, and I would continue this important work as a member of the PSF Board. I am excited by the prospect of contributing to the growth and evolution of Python on a global scale after seeing how PSF contributes to other communities at PyconUS2024, and I would be honored to serve in this role.
