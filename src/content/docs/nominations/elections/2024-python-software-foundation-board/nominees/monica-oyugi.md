Over the past three years, I have had the privilege of organizing PyConKenya, where I have honed critical skills in event planning, team leadership, and fostering an inclusive environment. Beyond my organizational work, I have also mentored numerous aspiring Python developers, helping them find their footing within the community. I am deeply committed to growing the Python user base, particularly in underrepresented regions, and I would bring this same dedication to the PSF Board.


In addition to my community leadership experience, I am also an accomplished Python programmer with a track record of innovative problem\-solving. I have contributed to several widely adopted open\-source packages, and I have a history of identifying pain points within the community and spearheading creative solutions. On the PSF Board, I would leverage this technical expertise to provide valuable insights and help address the evolving needs of Python users worldwide.


Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values that I have championed throughout my involvement in the Python community, and I would continue this important work as a member of the PSF Board. I am excited by the prospect of contributing to the growth and evolution of Python on a global scale after seeing how PSF contributes to other communities at PyconUS2024, and I would be honored to serve in this role.
