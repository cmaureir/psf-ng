I am Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe, an open\-source community builder, programs manager, researcher, and STEM education advocate from Ghana who loves seeing people empowered by technology. My initial experience with Python was at my first Django Girls Accra experience as a mentee. I subsequently joined the Python Ghana community and eventually became the lead for the PyLadies Ghana community. Although I wrote code around that time, I developed a deep passion for bringing people together to learn, share resources and network. Throughout the years, together with other volunteers, I helped organize several Python events for the Ghanaian and African Python Communities, such as Python Ghana, PyData Ghana, PyCon Africa, etc..


Being curious and excited to connect more Pythonistas from our global communities with the PyLadies Ghana community, I started contributing to PyLadies Global through the communications team and inviting guest speakers and facilitators to our events. Gradually, I encouraged and supported the start of new PyLadies chapters across Africa and other parts of the world. I have been contributing to PyCon US over the years as an online and in\-person volunteer and at the PSF booth, the recently held PyCon 2024 inclusive. I led the lightning talks session and look forward to continuing in this regard at future PyCons.


Through these commitments, I have found purpose in contributing to Open Source through community building. I am poised to do more to serve others while spreading Python, particularly within Africa and the global community. 


Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts
I have spoken at global conferences such as EuroPython, DjangoCon US and advocated for the spread and use of Python in Africa.
Mentored at several Django Girls events in Ghana and co\-organized Django Girls PyCon Africa.
Hosted, organized and collaborated on several events for PyLadies Ghana, increasing the participation of women in the Python Community.

Started a book drive known as Books for Techies, where I donate books to people getting started with their Tech careers in Africa
