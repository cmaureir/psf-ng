# 


Hello, I am Karo Ladino\-Puerto, also known as Karobot. I've been leading PyLadies Colombia since 2018, dedicating my time to organizing and coordinating events and sponsorships for BogotÃ¡, MedellÃ­n, and Cali. My main goal is to increase the presence of women in the tech industry through various initiatives such as blogs, panels, activities, workshops, networking events, and collaborations with companies to facilitate women's entry into the tech sector. I've been a Python Software Foundation fellow since 2020\. Additionally, I founded a community for Product Management called "Mujeres y Producto" (in English: Women and Product), emphasizing that development, creation, and diversity in the digital world are essential not only from where we come from but also to where we are going.


# Contributions to the Python Community


Over the past few years, I've worked to empower women in the Python community. I've organized numerous events in various cities across Colombia, focusing on creating workshops and activities that foster learning and confidence in women's tech skills. Moreover, I've collaborated with companies to sponsor events and provide job opportunities for women, facilitating their entry into the tech industry. My commitment to the community extends through writing blogs and participating in panels that highlight the importance of diversity and inclusion in tech. I've been a keynote speaker at PyLATAM and PyCon Bolivia and have co\-organized PyCon Colombia since 2020\. Furthermore, I've given talks at PyDay Cali, PyDay Pereira, and many other Python events. I've also helped organize Django Girls Workshops, PyLadies events, and the Humble Data Workshop in Colombia and Mexico.


# How I can contribute to the PSF Board


With my experience leading PyLadies Colombia and my deep understanding of the needs and challenges women face in technology, I can bring a valuable perspective to the Board. I am committed to organizing and promoting initiatives encouraging women's participation in the Python community, including mentorship programs, specialized workshops, and networking events. Additionally, I've experience collaborating with companies and organizations to secure resources and support that benefit the community. Understanding the needs and challenges of people from Latin America, I can help the board create initiatives that address the unique aspects of our large and diverse community. I'm also pretty fun to be around ðŸ˜…


# Why I want to join the PSF Board


My desire to join the PSF Board stems from my passion for promoting diversity and inclusion within the Python community. I aim to create an environment where women feel safe, supported, and valued. My goal is to increase women's confidence and presence in all aspects of Python development and maintenance, leveraging the visibility we have gained and working to overcome the challenges we still face. In addition to my efforts in organizing and creating spaces for sharing and growth, I want to expand my commitment to the Python community.
I am a very detail\-oriented person who believes that, even in community work, we should always strive for the best possible outcomes. I believe in over\-communicating to ensure that everyone understands and feels understood. Communication is key to ensuring all parties are on the same page. I value reliability, empathy, and giving. I believe not everything requires a huge budget; it's more about the mindset and how we organize ourselves. At the end of the day, seeing the smiles of people in my community and knowing I've touched lives fulfills me.


# Objectives as a Board Member


As a member of the PSF Board, my objectives include:


* Increasing the visibility and confidence of women in the Python community.
* Promoting mentorship and professional development initiatives.
* Working closely with other organizations to foster an inclusive and diverse environment.
* Listening to multiple communities in as many languages as possible to understand what the Python community wants in the coming years and how the language is evolving. Based on current trends and information, I aim to identify the events, groups, and activities the Python Software Foundation can promote.
* Helping document these processes and sharing outreach about what the Python Software Foundation does, contributing to content creation and information for everyone willing to engage in activities alongside the Foundation.
Improving communications towards the Latin American audience, ensuring Spanish content is on par with English content. Also, helping other languages participate. Additionally, helping to define content strategies to increase awareness of initiatives, making them clearer and more impactful.


# Conclusion


I am committed to providing opportunities and support to the Python community, working to achieve greater diversity, equity, and inclusion. I firmly believe in creating environments where all individuals, regardless of their background, gender, or ability, have equal opportunities to participate and thrive. I am ready to take on this challenge and make a meaningful contribution to the growth and continued success of the Python community.
