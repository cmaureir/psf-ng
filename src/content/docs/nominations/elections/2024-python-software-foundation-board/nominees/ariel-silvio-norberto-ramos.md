In Northern Argentina we develop technology activities in the "Society or Community", sharing training and research experiences in the university environment, this impacts positively on the "Society or Community" in all its age groups and all academic levels. With Python Philosophy (since 2014\), everything turned out much better. We are sharing these experiences, achieved knowledge and developed infrastructure (https://vpsjupyter.seunsa.ar) in as many small cities or towns in the North of Argentina and in cities of bordering countries. We are close to the center of South America. https://maps.app.goo.gl/foP9KjYK7tEB3zmd9 (Ciudad\-de\-Salta/@\-24\.78809,\-65\.4116669\). We are strengthening the groups of young people formed in the North, West and East region of Argentina and if possible in South American cities. Being part of the Board is a very good and motivating circumstance. We will continue working, beyond the results, as now, putting together the nomination in the middle of a teaching trip. We know that reality simply happens and we must know how to react in order to achieve a better present and future for young people.


Thank you for your time!
