I am **Ivy Fung** from Malaysia. Since 2019, I have been actively involved in organizing PyCon Malaysia. I volunteered to be the chairperson for PyCon APAC 2020 and had to face the challenge of turning the event around to be a virtual event in a short time. The following few years were a tough recovery period, just like all other PyCons were facing. Through these years, the PyCon MY team has learned valuable lessons, and I think the following 3 are the main learning I have:


1. It is important to have support from other communities. We received support from PyCon communities and other communities around the world. I realized, that to receive help, others need to know that we exist and are active.
2. We need to know who to reach out to. That means to actively participate in the communities.
3. To know our vision and have the community in our hearts. That would drive us through the tough time.


#### My Objectives in Running for the Board


My experiences with Python communities past 5 years have encouraged me to step up to be for roles outside of Malaysia. There are 2 main objectives I am running for the board, and they are bilateral:


1. **Stand up and be counted**. The Malaysian community has been around for more than 10 years and has been running PyCon MY annually without fail, no matter how tough the time was. To continue supporting the community, to have the community's voice to be heard is one of the factors. As PyCon MY is one of the active communities of the APAC region, our presence is not only about Malaysia, but a larger community, particularly South East Asia where presence in PSF needs improvement.
2. **Communicating the goals of PSF**: I must admit that I know very little about the Python community in general for the first few years I have been organizing PyCon MY. I started actively to understand and share more about Python communities and participated in other PyCon and PyLadies events after I got to know more about it. The better way to be more involved is to help others to know more and to be more connected, and the best way is to be involved with upholding PSF’s vision and mission.


#### My experiences and work\-in\-progress:


* Organized PyCon MY since 2019
* Chairperson for PyCon APAC 2020\. Successfully transitioned PyCon APAC 2020 to an online format due to the global pandemic. This event focused on panel discussions with speakers from different industries and communities to share their experiences and points of view.
* Established connections with PyCon organizers regionally.
* Volunteered for translation and emceeing at PyLadies events.
* Actively participated and spoke in PyCons across the APAC region.
* Aimed to make PyCon MY more sustainable
* Groom successors.
* Collaborated with local authorities and communities to promote PyCon MY.


***\*******中文版******\******我是来自马来西亚的** Ivy Fung\*\*。自 2019 年以来，我一直积极参与筹办 PyCon Malaysia。我自愿担任 PyCon APAC 2020 的主席，并不得不面对在短时间内将活动转变为线上活动的挑战。接下来的几年是一段艰难的恢复期，就像所有其他 PyCon 所面临的一样。这些年来，PyCon MY 团队学到了宝贵的经验教训，我认为以下 3 点是我学到的重点：


1. 获得其他社区的支持很重要。我们得到了 PyCon 社区和世界各地其他社区的支持。我意识到，要获得帮助，其他人需要知道我们的存在和并且保持社区的活跃。
2. 我们需要知道该联系谁。这意味着要积极参与社区活动。
3. 了解我们的愿景，以社区为的利益出发点。这愿景帮助我们度过艰难时期。


#### 我竞选董事会的目标


过去 5 年我在 Python 社区的经历鼓励我站出来担任马来西亚以外的职位。我竞选董事会有两个主要的双向目标：


1. **站出来并被重视**。马来西亚社区已经存在了 10 多年。无论多么艰难，我门每年都坚持举办 PyCon MY，从未间断。继续支持社区，让社区的声音被听到是其中一个因素。由于 PyCon MY 是亚太地区活跃的社区之一，我们的存在不仅针对马来西亚，还针对更大的社区，特别是东南亚，PyCon MY 在PSF 中的存在需要加强。
2. **传达 PSF 的目标**：我必须承认，在筹办 PyCon MY 的最初几年里，我对 PyCon MY 以外社区的了解甚少。在对 Python 社区有了更多了解之后，我开始积极地了解和分享更多关于 Python 社区的信息，并参加了其他 PyCon 和 PyLadies 活动。我觉得，参与的更好方法是帮助其他人了解更多并建立更多联系，最好的方法是参与维护 PSF 的愿景和使命。


我的经历和正在进行的工作：
自 2019 年起组织 PyCon MY
PyCon APAC 2020 主席。由于全球疫情，成功将 PyCon APAC 2020 转变为线上形式。本次活动以小组讨论为主，来自不同行业和社区的演讲者分享他们的经验和观点。
与地区 PyCon 组织者建立联系。
在 PyLadies 活动中担任翻译和主持志愿者。
积极参与亚太地区 PyCon 并发表演讲。
旨在让 PyC​​on MY 更具可持续性
培养继任者。
与当地政府和社区合作推广 PyCon MY。
