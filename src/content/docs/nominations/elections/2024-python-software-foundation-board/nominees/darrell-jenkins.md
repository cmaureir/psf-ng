*Location:* Washington State, USA


My love for programming began in childhood from when the Commodore 64 was a thing, to experimenting with BASIC and Pascal. After living a diverse life full of other interests, I jumped headfirst into Python in July 2023\. I absolutely love the Python programming language and the community around it! The PyCascades 2024 sessions were incredible, and I am so grateful that I was in a position to attend in person. 


More importantly, I firmly believe that my service to the Python Software Foundation would bring a unique perspective and set of capabilities that would be of great value to the Python community. Commitment to something so important as this requires the ability to see projects through to completion and knowing when to pivot or adjust course. It involves recognizing the value and strength of the team effort which includes not only the Board, but the entire Python community. 


# Community Contributions


Although the PuPPy (Puget Sound Programming Python) monthly meetings are a good 2\.5\-hour drive away from my location, I have strived to be actively involved both in person and via Slack. In fact, I had the privilege of giving an in person lightning talk in April 2024\. My theme was “Learning How to Learn Python” (https://youtu.be/lJsTeBwhBGg?si\=PK8eQsV4mmKV7PzB). The best part of that experience was being able to help newcomers feel understood, and also making so many connections in the Python community. Between October 2023 and March 2024, I volunteered with West Sound CoderDojo in Silverdale, WA helping kids and their parents find a welcoming, helpful local venue to celebrate coding. Outside of Python, I participate as a member of the Clallam County Economic Development Council and the North Olympic Development Council.


Most notably, in 2023 I began reflecting on how to better serve local business owners. People needed a place to gather that did not require membership fees but still had value. So in June 2023 I Co\-Founded the *It’s All About YOU – Business Networking Group*. It provides a platform where people can meet and share what makes them successful, and also share challenges they have. Our one\-hour meetings are designed to provide brief practical educational segments (like fraud prevention), feature a local nonprofit guest speaker, and then the remaining time is for everyone to interact with each other. The program has been well received and I hope to expand it into additional regions.


# Background


I grew up in a town that hosted people of all backgrounds and I love getting to know people of all diversities. I am a pianist and published popular science author. My book *First Light and Beyond – Making a Success of Astronomical Observing* was published in 2015 by Springer as part of the Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series. As a commercial banker in my local community, I help educate business owners on how they can gain access to valuable resources to help their businesses thrive. The best part is seeing their business grow after I help them acquire those resources. These combined aspects of my background will help serve the PSF and the community by offering creativity, advanced writing skills, and a solid financial framework. Having experienced entry into Python myself over the last 10 months or so would also help me to serve the PSF as an authentic voice and advocate for newcomers to the Python language and its community.


# Objectives


*The following are just a few ideas that I believe would be helpful to the Python community if I were to serve as a PSF board member.*


*Communication:* Communication is not simply the belief that we have delivered information to the recipient. It involves a mutual understanding that real communication and a beneficial exchange of ideas has taken place. I want to help make that happen. Additionally, we need cross pollination, not only between the PSF and Core Developers to Python enthusiasts, but also between the PSF to Core Developers. The community would also love to hear more often from both the PSF and Core Developers in various ways that are truly accessible.


*Transparency:* It’s important that people who are passionate about Python and its community better understand the processes, procedures, and challenges that are normally behind the scenes. While excess details are not needed, a more open look at Python’s key people (and their activities) can be helpful to inspire greater participation while helping mold Python’s innovators and leaders of tomorrow.


*Education:* After spending 10 years teaching piano to children and adults, I am passionate about education. I believe that we can do so much more to promote education around the Python language which will not only benefit the Python ecosystem but also help bring people together. Strong communities are the glue of humanity. Better training for volunteers and staff for Python’s annual events will also benefit everyone by extending the already inclusive environment to be more welcoming, encouraging, and engaging.


# Summary


I am a professional, experienced candidate who brings a unique perspective to what it means to support the Python community. As an amicable, agreeable person I am someone who can work in harmony with all kinds of people for the support of both existing needs and objectives of the Python Software Foundation, as well as contribute fresh ideas to help propel us forward into new territory. I am committed to sustained efforts of valuable contributions to this community, and I know you are too.
