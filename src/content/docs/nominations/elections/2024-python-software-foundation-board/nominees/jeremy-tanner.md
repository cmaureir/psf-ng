I'm Jeremy Tanner, an organizer, speaker, sponsor, Python developer and community member.


I believe in the mission of the Python Software Foundation; to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. 


I believe I can help the PSF carry out its mission.


I'd like to work improving the sustainability of the PSF, its infrastructure projects, grants program, and events across all regions through a focus on fundraising and supporting membership growth. Messaging the value and work of the PSF to those able to contribute and serving as a PSF ambassador to adjacent communities. 


I've enjoyed being in the Python community as we grow to look more like the world. There's more room to grow and I'd like to help. 


Thanks for considering me, I hope to see you at something Python related soon! 


Also, I'm a 'Yes' vote on the three proposed bylaws changes on this ballot.
