I'm "lecovi," also known as Leandro Enrique Colombo Viña, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I've been a member of the Python Argentina community since 2013, starting as a lurker in the mailing list and gradually becoming more involved. In 2014, with some tech friends, I co\-founded bitson, a cooperative software development enterprise for small and medium\-sized businesses in Argentina, utilizing Python and other open\-source tools.


In 2015, bitson, along with other cooperatives, successfully proposed and organized the Python Conference in Argentina. I proudly served as the Chair of the 8th PyCon Argentina in Bahía Blanca. Following years of discussion, a group of Python enthusiasts founded the Python Argentina NGO in 2016, and I have been its Treasurer ever since.
