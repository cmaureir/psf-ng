# 


Hi everyone! My name is Filipe La√≠ns (they/them or he/him), and I am a self\-taught developer from Portugal. I really enjoy tinkering with things and understanding how they work, which is how I got started with programming. My hobbies include electronics, physics, and culture. A lot of my time away from the computer is spent traveling and watching live shows.


##### Feel free to jump to the goals section if you don't have much time to look at my background and motivation!


# Experience üêç


I have a deep technical background in both Python, and Linux packaging, and am currently employed at [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/), where I work on Python packaging. I am also a Python core developer and an active contributor to Scientific Python ecosystem.


Here are some relevant key points of my experience:


* [Python core](https://github.com/python/cpython)
* In the standard library, I mainly focus on [`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html) and [`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html).
* Maintainer of [`importlib_resources`](https://github.com/python/importlib_resources) and [`importlib_metadata`](https://github.com/python/importlib_metadata).
* [Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)](https://github.com/pypa)
* Author and maintainer of [`pypa/build`](https://github.com/pypa/build) and [`pypa/pyproject-metadata`](https://github.com/pypa/pyproject-metadata).
* Maintainer of [`distutils`](https://github.com/pypa/distutils) (base codebase for [`setuptools`](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools)).
* Organization triager (*Gardener*).
* [Python Packaging Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org)
* Organization triager (*Gardener*).
* [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)
* Packager for over 6 years, and currently maintain over [250 packages](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=FFY00&flagged=).
* [meson\-python](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python)
* Original author and did most of the initial work.
	+ This allowed to move [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), etc. away from [`distutils`](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/distutils.html).
* [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org)
* Maintainer.
* [Conda](https://github.com/conda/conda)
* Contributor.


You can find more details about my technical work on my [website](https://ffy00.github.io/) and [Github profile](https://github.com/FFY00).


As part of my work, I have also done a lot of outreach onto to many different parts of the Python community. The goal being to make sure they are heard and their concerns are taken into account during packaging and [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) development.


On top of my technical background, I also have experience in community building and am an active member of the community.


* [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org)
* Organizer of the [Packaging Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/packaging-summit/) at PyCon US for 2 years.
	+ This has given me invaluable insight into the particular issues of users.
* Mentor for the [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) project on the [Mentored Sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/mentored-sprints/) for 2 years.
* Sprinted on multiple projects, such as [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) and [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org).
* Conference volunteer for 2 years.
* [PyCon Portugal](https://pycon.pt)
* Presented the [*Getting started with (modern) Python packaging*](https://2023.pycon.pt/talks/schedule/schedule/pycon-pt-2023/talk/UVAQW3/index.html) talk in 2023\.


Outside Python, I have been volunteering and helping organize several local community events for many years, with a focus on culture, music, etc.


# Motivation üí≠


I am very passionate about the Python community and want to make sure everyone feels heard, included, and have the resources they need.


One thing in particular I want to advocate for is a better user and developer experience. I believe this can be achieved by combining more outreach into Python communities and placing more resources on the Python packaging ecosystem. Seeing the work of the current board on supporting the Python core team, I am confident similar strides can be made on the Python user experience ‚Äî particularly the *new user* experience ‚Äî by putting resources into it.


From my experience, both on the technical side and my outreach work, UX and packaging are critical areas that haven't been receiving much funding or attention. I believe the PSF can make a big impact on this, and that's what I want to advocate for. Over the years I have talked with many users about their frustrations, difficulties, and overall experiences in using Python for a wide variety of applications, so I feel strongly about my ability to advocate for them.


# Goals üéØ


* Improve the user experience for new users, lowering the barrier of entry to Python, and programming in general.
	+ E.g. Improve the process of getting started with Python, by improving the documentation, SEO, user experience (UX) consistency, binary distribution methods, etc.
* Support the Python packaging community by providing them with the resources needed to achieve a better and more cohesive user experience.
	+ E.g. Fund user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX) research and technical viability discovery work.
* Engage with external stakeholders (e.g. distributors), as needed, in order to ensure the integrity of the Python distribution. This contributes to the two goals listed above.
* Continue the PSF's work on supporting the Python core team, ensuring the longevity of the language.
* Encourage collaboration between the various different Python communities and user groups, making sure everyone feels part of, and represented, in the Python community.
	+ E.g. Reach out to user groups, and event organizers, for feedback more often. Create bridges between different parts of the community. etc.
* Create a better path of discussion between the technical teams and the end users, by trying to incorporate feedback from user groups into the technical decision/design process.
	+ E.g. Invest in user\-advocacy work. Reach out to user groups and create and ask for UX and DX feedback. Have people who are skilled in UX and have some technical background act as bridges between users and technical stakeholders. etc.
