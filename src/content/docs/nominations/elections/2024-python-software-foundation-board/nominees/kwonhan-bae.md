# 


One year is too short. Over the past year, I have learned a great deal from the PSF, and I would like the opportunity to contribute more to the community with this valuable experience.


# What I Learned as PSF Board Member


Through my efforts to connect within the Asian region where I reside, I've come to realize something important. Not only in Asia but also in Africa and other regions, there are many talented individuals with the potential to contribute to the Python ecosystem. However, due to lack of connections or information, we are not collaborating with these individuals. I aim to strengthen and expand these unconnected areas.


My involvement with the PSF's Conduct Working Group has taught me a great deal and clarified what we need to do. We have learned what aspects we need to consider and maintain to connect more and be more inclusive of a wider range of people. This is crucial for the growth and development of our community.


# My Vision and Experience for Python Community Growth


First and foremost, I believe in the importance of community\-based contributors, as opposed to only major library or core developers. While technical contributions are undeniably crucial, I firmly believe that a thriving, diverse, and inclusive community is equally important for the sustained growth and influence of Python worldwide.


For over a decade, I have fostered such a community in Korea. My work has involved founding and leading a Python user group, thereby creating a solid platform for Python enthusiasts to share knowledge, collaborate, and grow together.


My commitment to the Python community was exemplified when I delivered a lightning talk at PyCon US 2023\. The talk provided a comprehensive overview of my vision and work. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54q_cPCNNS8&t=172s)


When creating PyCon Korea, I was fortunate to receive significant support and guidance from friends in Japan and Taiwan, which was instrumental in the success of the initiative. This experience of international collaboration not only strengthened our local community but also enriched my understanding of community building. I am now able to pay this forward, using the insights and experiences gained to assist friends in other countries to develop their Python communities.


In my professional capacity, I am currently employed at LINEYAHOO, a major messaging company based in Japan. Although the company primarily uses Java for application development, I, as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), strive to utilize Python in developing and managing the company's infrastructure. Further, I am actively encouraging developers within the company to adopt Python and participate in the wider Python community. This work reflects my belief in the value Python can bring to any organization and my commitment to its growth.


Through the organization of user meetups, I have been instrumental in establishing community standards and propagating concepts such as the Code of Conduct. This model has since been adopted by various IT communities across Korea, with many looking to PyCon Korea as a standard of Community Driven IT Conference.


My community\-building efforts also extend to the international stage, where I have been part of the organization of PyCon APAC. Collaborating with teams across the region has granted me a broader perspective on the diverse needs and potential of the Python community in the Asia Pacific.


Having led PyCon Korea for nine years, I am currently working on transitioning leadership to the next generation, a process that has further honed my skills in cultivating leadership and ensuring the sustainability of community initiatives.


In conclusion, my experience and commitment to the Python community, both locally and internationally, equip me well for the Director position within the PSF. I am eager to leverage my passion for community building and my leadership experience to contribute to the Python Software Foundation at this higher level.


Thank you for considering my nomination. I look forward to the possibility of serving the Python community in this capacity.
