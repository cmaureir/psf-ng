## Dustin Ingram



* **Previous Board Service**: New board member
* **Employer**: Google
* **Other Affiliations**: PyPA, PyTexas, Philly Python Users Group
* **Nomination Statements**:
	+ ***Nomination by***: Kevin Horn
	 
	I hereby nominate Dustin Ingram (di@python.org) as a candidate for the Board of Directors of the Python Software Foundation.
	
	
	Over the past several years, Dustin has demonstrated a strong commitment to the health and well\-being of the Python community, participating in the development and maintenance of the new PyPI codebase (Warehouse), participating heavily in producing PyTexas 2017, serving as the Conference Chair of PyTexas 2019, and serving as a board member of the PyTexas Foundation.
	
	
	I believe he would make an excellent addition to the Board.
	+ ***Nomination by***: Chris Wilcox
	 
	Dustin Ingram is an active member of the Python community and has played a critical part in the Python Packaging Authority, helping with both governance as well as maintaining PyPI. He has also an organizer for PyTexas, a regional Python conference. In addition to this, Dustin is an exceptionally empathetic developer. As a developer advocate he spends his days better understanding the concerns of other developers and working to make products better for them. 
	
	
	I think his variety of experiences would make him a valuable board member.
	+ ***Nomination by***: Sarah Gray
	 
	I had the pleasure of working with Dustin in his prior role as a senior developer and consultant at PromptWorks in Philadelphia. In our time working together, Dustin helped me level\-up individually as a Python developer while making substantial contributions to both our local python user group as a regular speaker and the larger Python community as a recurring speaker at PyCon. He's also a PyPI maintainer and played a big role in the migration to the rewritten version of PyPI\-\- woo hoo! In every circumstance, Dustin exemplified the best of the Python community \-\- a deep understanding of the language, humility, generosity, curiosity, and desire to help others. Dustin would be a great addition to the PSF board for his both his knowledge and his gracious approach to problem solving.
	+ ***Nomination by***: Paul Ganssle
	 
	Dustin is well\-known to those of us in the packaging world for his talent, his equable demeanor and his community\-minded spirit. He played an important role in the Python Packaging Authority at a critical time in our history by serving as a maintainer and adminstrator for the warehouse project during the famously smooth transition to pypi.org. As part of this effort, he got direct first\-hand experience working with the PSF and Mozilla to administer the MOSS grant used to fund the PyPI migration. As we in the PyPA started to think about adding a governance model, Dustin was the unanimous choice among PyPA committers for "Benevolent Dictator for Right Now", and he continues to push forward a formalization of our governance structure.
	
	
	Dustin is also well\-known for his communication skills; he is a frequent speaker at Python conferences around the world, and is a fantastic writer and popularizer. During the PyPI migration, he and others involved appeared on several podcasts (FLOSS Weekly, Talk Python to Me), promoting the project and getting the word out about how it would affect the community. His much\-lauded and widely\-discussed article [PyPI As a Service](https://dustingram.com/articles/2019/04/02/pypi-as-a-service/) exploring the challenges we would face if we were to turn PyPI into a for\-profit service, shows that he is a pragmatic thinker with the far\-too\-rare skill of being able to clearly articulate his thoughts.
	
	
	Many of Dustin's activities \- as an organizer of PyTexas, as a speaker at conferences, as an open source contributor and participant in sprints \- clearly show his dedication to the Python community. For this reason and many more, I think that Dustin Ingram would make an excellent addition to the Python Software Foundation board.
	+ ***Nomination by***: Timothy Allen
	 
	Dustin Ingram has served the Python community with distinction for several years. I first met Dustin through the Philadelphia Python community, as we are both members of the Philadelphia Python Users Group. Dustin was always enthusiastic, whether giving a presentation or helping a newcomer stuck on a problem. Since then, he has taken that enthusiasm to Texas and a new job with Google as a Developer Advocate.
	
	
	His service to the community has been amazing, as one of the driving forces behind the Warehouse Project, which gave a much\-needed makeover to the Python Package Index. He is a member of the Python Packaging Authority, helping maintain pip, and is an organizer of the PyTexas conference. He continues to present at user groups and conferences throughout the Python ecosystem. Dustin will make a great addition to the PSF board.
	+ ***Nomination by***: Thea Flowers
	 
	Dustin has already served the Python community in various ways:
	
	
	
		- He works on PSF infra/tooling including PyPI.
		- Organized PyTexas.
		- Has given talks at *numerous* Python conferences.
		- Advocates for the needs of Python users within Google.
	Finally, Dustin is just exceedingly tall. He's possibly the tallest candidate, maybe to date.
	+ ***Nomination by***: Jon Banafato
	 
	I nominate Dustin Ingram for the PSF Board of Directors. Dustin is a positive force in the Python community through his work on packaging infrastructure and as a PyTexas conference organizer, as well as his frequent speaking and attendance at conferences and user groups. He cares for this community and is quick to support others and to step up when a task needs action. I have no doubt that he would continue to act in the community's best interest as a member of the board.
