I am a CPython core developer, and also a fellow at PSF. I am also co\-chairing the PSF grants working group, and worked as the communications officer on the board. Other than volunteering for PyCon US in various roles, I also help as the sprint coordinator in the conference. 


I chaired the PyCon Pune, it is a new regional PyCon started from 2017 with goals to create more upstream contributors.


I work as a public interest technologist with a non\-profit called [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/) where we protect, defend, and empower public\-interest journalism in the 21st century. I help to maintain [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org), which is an open source whistleblower submission system (written in Python) that media organizations and NGOs can install to securely accept documents from anonymous sources. 


## Goals for 2019


* Work as a bridge with the CPython core developers, the larger workflow/infrastructure ecosystem and the PSF (along with the help of Thomas and other developers) so that we can support the sustainability of the projects as required.
* I will continue helping out the Python community in the places outside of EU/US region, thus helping in growing the membership and reach of PSF to the larger community worldwide. Last year, I have given talk about PSF in PyCon India and also continued helping out the other regional conferences.
* Helping out local PyLadies groups to grow effective and self\-reliant.
* Focus more on the grants working group to make sure that we are able to provide the necessary guidance and help to the different events across the globe.
* Helping out in the regular activities of the PSF.
