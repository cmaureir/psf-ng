My community work is about trying to bring opportunities to everyone who wants to get involved in programming or Python community.


* Co\-chair and co\-organizer of the PyCon Charlas track during PyCon North America.
* Founder and organizer of PythonDay México, the first conference about Python in Mexico
* Participation in several local meetups and conferences, giving talks and workshops
* Organizer of a monthly meetup about Python in Mexico City
* Organizer of Women Who Code Python webinars in Spanish and Portuguese


I like to bring opportunities to as many people as possible because someone once gave me those opportunities. I think this is the essence of a community... Giving back!


I want to be part of the PSF board because I want to give back more to this amazing community, the work of everyone in it it’s so meaningful to each and every person who uses Python so I want to contribute in a more supportive way.


I'm very committed to achieving the goals that I set to myself.


### Goals as a board member:


* Understand what is needed in the community.
* Identify places where local communities can be created.
* Support the creation of new communities, local meetups and conferences in Latin America.
