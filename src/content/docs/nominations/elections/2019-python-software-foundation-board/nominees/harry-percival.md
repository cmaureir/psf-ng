I've been lucky enough to be writing Python for pretty much the entirety of my programming career (we'll gloss over my time as a Lotus Notes developer) and I feel quite committed to the language and its community, now.


I'm really curious to see how we take on the new challenges of the coming year, particularly as regards financing. I hope I can help find ways to increase our fundraising, and eventually be able to sponsor more activities, including core development, as well as continuing our commitment to diversity, inclusion and community.


I hope everyone appreciates that I used the word community twice, and as a British person that's very hard for me to do with a straight face, as is expressing any kind of emotion. But I do love this language and the people involved in it, so I hope I can help.
