# 


My name is Jannis Leidel, better known in the Python and Django community under my alias **[jezdez](https://twitter.com/jezdez)**, and I have been a Python developer for 12 years.


For the last 6 years I’ve worked at Mozilla, first as a web developer on the Mozilla Developer Network ([MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org)) and later as a software and data engineer working on data analysis tools for the [Firefox Data Pipeline](https://telemetry.mozilla.org).


## Experience


I have experience in writing, maintaining and managing Open Source projects, e.g.


* Google Summer of Code student for Django, to integrate it with Python packaging tools, 2007
* Django Core Team member 2009\-2018
	+ translation coordinator
	+ Technical Board member
	+ founder and member of Django Ops team
	+ maintainer of the Django website
	+ co\-lead of first Django fundraising campaign and platform
* Founder and member of the German Django non\-profit, since 2009
* pip and virtualenv core developer and release manager, 2009\-2013
* Chairman of DjangoCon Europe, 2010, Berlin, Germany
* Founder of the [Python Packaging Authority](https://www.pypa.io/) (PyPA), 2011, to take ownership for pip and virtualenv from Ian Bicking
* Developer and admin for the Python Package Index (aka Cheeseshop), 2012\-2013
* Django Software Foundation board member, 2014\-2015
* Mentor at first Django Girls tutorial, 2014, Berlin, Germany
* Google Summer of Code mentor and admin for Django and Mozilla for multiple years
* [Caniusepython3\.com](https://caniusepython3.com) — Developer of the web version of Brett Cannon’s caniusepython3 CLI tool
* [Jazzband](https://jazzband.co) — Creator and “roadie” of a collaborative community on GitHub to share the responsibility of maintaining Python projects
* Mozilla\-internal champion for the successful [MOSS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/) (Mozilla Open Source Software program) grant for the PSF to improve sustainability of the Python Package Index (PyPI)
* Co\-maintainer of [Redash](https://redash.io) — A Open Source software for teams to query, visualize and collaborate with data, since 2018
* Developer or maintainer of many other Python packages: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/jezdez/), [GitHub](https://github.com/jezdez/)


Nothing of this would have been possible without the support and encouragement from strangers that I met on the internet.


# Personal board goals


The reasons why I’d like to run for the PSF board are two\-fold at the moment.


I look forward to refining them based on my guiding principles together with my fellow board members and community colleagues.


## Guiding principles


* Community building means clear values, an ethical mission, diverse backgrounds and respectful collaboration.
* Trust those with domain knowledge and support everyone to attain it.
* Build partnerships, not silos.


## 1\. Support and extend the use of Python for a community of people by lowering the barrier for educational, scientific and commercial use


* Increase spending on opportunity and project grants as a key part of the PSF’s mission.
* Introduce paid Python internships in PSF member organizations to create the next generation of Python community members.
* More closely associate the PSF with other organizations that overlap in their missions, e.g. pool funds or collaborate on common goals like grant\-giving.


## 2\. Build and strengthen the PSF’s role in the research and development of the Python language and ecosystem


* Create an R\&D arm in the PSF that allows the community of organizations (e.g. PSF member organizations) to easier reinvest in Python as a foundational technology for their success.
* Enable the Scientific Python community to more closely engage the Python language community in working with emerging technologies such as WebAssembly.
* Engage with documentation, design, security and project management experts to strengthen Python’s ongoing work in those fields.
