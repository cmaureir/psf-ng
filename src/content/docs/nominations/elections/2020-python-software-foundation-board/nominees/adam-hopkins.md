I have been a long time user of Python (20\+ years), and am deeply inspired and motivated to give back to the community. I work as a lead developer, and also spend whatever time I can in open source. 


Off the top of my head, here are some additional qualities that I think will help my candidacy.


* Core maintainer of the organization behind the Sanic framework
* Licensed attorney in Massachusetts
* Member of local building committee
* 5,000\+ points on Stackoverflow (mainly from answering Python questions)
