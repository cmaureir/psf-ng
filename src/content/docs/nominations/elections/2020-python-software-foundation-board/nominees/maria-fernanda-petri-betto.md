I am a Brazilian Economics PhD candidate and member of the Python education community. I provide a quick summary of my qualifications and goals that I have if elected. You can find my personal site [here](https://mfpb.me).


## Qualifications


### Programming


I have a few years of experience using Python to conduct Economic and Financial simulations for my research. I also have experience with data science tools from working with large data sets. I currently use Python for all of my work but previously used other languages including C\+\+ and R. I have also used Python in a few small web development projects including Econ Ipsum â€“ a lorem ipsum generator that uses words from papers in Economics.


### Financial


I conduct theoretical and empirical research on auctions and bond markets. Because of this, I have an understanding of the financial system and sophisticated financial instruments. I believe that I can use this knowledge to push forward the financial security of the PSF.


### Community


In my role as a PhD candidate at Northwestern University, I help students learn Python. Because of this, I have some recent involvement with the Python education community. I am currently working with the education group to create the Python in Education landing page.


I was also slated to present a poster about my research process at the PyCon USA 2020\.


## Goals


* **Enhance financial security** The PSF is obviously in a bad place financially due to the cancellation of PyCon. I hope to focus heavily on improving the financial maturity of the foundation and generating new sources of revenue. I believe that there are many opportunities available to strengthen both financial security and the foundation's relationship with the greater Python community.
* **Improve educational mission** I would like to focus on making the Python education community easier for educators to find and join. I would also like to explore having the PSF approve some training programs. This could generate revenue for the PSF and build a closer relationship with these educators.
* **Outreach** As a Brazilian, I would love to help expand the PSFs efforts to engage with the fast\-growing Python community in Latin America. Moreover, I want to foster Python's continued growth with traditionally underrepresented groups.
