I am a geek turned entrepreneur. I run, [Python Weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com/), one of the most popular newsletters for Python. I have been using Python for number of years now and I am well connected in the Python community. Python is already a popular language and my goal is to help continue the spread of Python usage across various industries. I am intrigued by the possibilities with Python for the latest and greatest products and technologies that are being developed across the world in number of different domains.
