Hi Team, 
I hope you are going well in this tough time. 


I have been part of the community ecosystem for the past few years. Before that, to be frank, I didn't even know why communities are important, what value to adds and how can I give back. Fortunately today I know a community is a safe place where everyone irrespective of their backgrounds is welcomed and given an opportunity to unleash their talent. I was always an underconfident brat with no social interaction. The power of community bonding helped me to open up and stand for myself and others. 
My aim is to eradicate various myths that evolve around gender, ethnicity, etc. We still have a very long journey ahead and I want to contribute to the Python Software Foundation with the same passion.
