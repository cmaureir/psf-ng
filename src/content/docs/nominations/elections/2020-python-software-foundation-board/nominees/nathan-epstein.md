I am self\-nominating for a position on the Python Software Foundation board out of a strongly held desire to help advance the Python programming language and the essential role that it plays within the ecosystem of scientific computing. 


In addition to the PSF, I am also a supporting member of NumFOCUS, the R Foundation, and Code Nation (where I have served as a volunteer teacher for students in under\-resourced high schools). 


I am a regular presenter at PyData and other conferences pertaining to topics in Python programming and data analytics around the world. I've developed several open source packages (within the PyPI repository and otherwise) which have meaningful user engagement. I am the author of numerous publications in academic journals and other online outlets related to software development, machine learning, and mathematics education.


### Primary Objectives:


* Expand the community of Python developers through outreach programs with a specific interest in students from under\-represented demographics. I'm particularly interested in initiatives which leverage Python's ease of use to facilitate adoption among first\-time programmers.
* Promote the essential role of Python within scientific computing by supporting strategically significant projects. This includes both foundational numerical frameworks (i.e. pandas, NumPy, etc.) as well as libraries in more nascent domains (i.e. deep learning, natural language processing, quantum computing, etc.).


I'm sincerely grateful for your consideration and your shared commitment to the advancement of a strong and inclusive Python community.
