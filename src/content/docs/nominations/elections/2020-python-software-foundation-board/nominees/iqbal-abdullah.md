I have been active with PyCon APAC and PyCon JP since 2010\. I have helped founded PyCon JP and also PyCon MY, and these conferences have been successful to attract current and new Python users and developers. I was also the chairperson for PyCon APAC 2017\.


My intention is to contribute to the PSF by giving input from the perspective of a member from the Asia Pacific reason. I also hope to evangelize for Python in general and the PSF specifically within the Asia Pacific region. Of late, there has been a lot of interest towards Python, in Asia Pacific and also in Japan. There has even been an attempt to register Python as a trademark in Japan unrelated to the PSF, which I have played a small role to try and stop. In terms of Python users, we are seeing greater participation within the Asia Pacific with the creation of new country specific PyCons, such as PyCon TH and PyCon ID, and I believe we need to put in more work by understanding and supporting these new communities coming up in this region.


I believe we need someone to act as a bridge and contribute back to the PSF and the worldwide Python community in general the values, views, concerns and support from the Asia Pacific community, and I will like to be that person.
