I have worked for 20 years in community affairs and in the development industry. My contributions on the Python side of things have been on IoT, Infrastructure Automation, Security and mentoring. I am passionate about fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in the ecosystem and I have engaged in numerous community affairs in many languages. I would like to represent LATAM and Spanish/Portuguese speakers as a board member. My goal is to be the person who fosters community participation.
