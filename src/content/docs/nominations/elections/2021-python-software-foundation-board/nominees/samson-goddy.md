Hi, Iâ€™m Samson Goddy, a software engineer, and an open source advocate. But I am derived mainly by community relations work to give back to the ecosystem and recently hired to build communities for a great company. I am the co\-founder of the largest open source group in Africa, called the Open Source Community Africa, and a long\-term contributor to the Sugar Labs project. This community\-driven organization maintains and distributes the Sugar Learning Desktop, a python\-based GUI for Linux from the One Laptop Per Child. 


Python has always been around me, from a child developer tinkering his way with the Sugar Desktop to teaching people the programming language. 


It will be an honor to be part of the PSF board as I believe in sustainability and outreach. 


My experience:


I was a board member for Sugar Labs; a US non\-profit organization that maintains the Sugar Learning Desktop from 2017 to 2020\. I joined the extraordinary mission to sustain open source with Open Source Collective as a Board Member, which I am still serving to date. 


I also built an open source community from the ground up to arguably the largest open source community in Africa, focusing on outreach, support, and mentorship. I created and chaired Open Source Festival, the flagship event from the Open Source Community Africa. We attracted top companies and individuals to the African community. 


I have had the opportunity to speak at Pycon US and Nigeria, which was a pleasant experience. While at Pycon US, I connected with the team, focusing on starting Pycon Africa on a round table discussion on supporting and growing the community.
