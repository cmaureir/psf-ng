You can learn a lot from me from this snippet:



```
class Adam:

    def __init__(self):
        self.work = PacketFabric(&quot;Lead Sr. Software Engineer&quot;)
        self.oss = Sanic(&quot;Core Maintainer&quot;)
        self.home = Israel(&quot;Negev&quot;)

    async def run(self, inputs: Union[Pretzels, Coffee]) -&gt; None:
        while True:
            await self.work.do(inputs)
            await self.oss.do(inputs)

    def sleep(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

```

*Sorry for the \&quot;, apparently the platform doesn't like my quotes. You can see a cleaner version on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ahopkins/)*


I am a very passionate supporter of Python, and have worked in the language for 20\+ years and experienced its growth. I worked bring the Sanic project into a community run organization, and created [the operating structure](https://sanicframework.org/en/guide/project/scope.html) for the community. Yes, I am also a **licensed attorney**, so I am one of those rare breeds of people that actually likes reading documents like that.


I would like to assist in the growth and planning of the PSF, and would work hard to participate. In addition to managing the Sanic project, I enjoy spending time mentoring young developers, and presenting talks at Python conferences. I am very dedicated, and would love to help drive the PSF forward.
