Like many others, my career as a Pythonista started after seeking support in learning from community members. I was fortunate that in San Diego, my community included many previous board members and PSF fellows. Over the last few years, my career shifted towards mentorship, encouraging them to become active in the Python community and pursue career paths that would allow them to contribute more actively to the community whether directly or in their spare time. This has included folks who were so encouraged that they spoke on\-stage for the first time at PyCon!


The past few years have forced the Python community to change its approach to engagement in many ways. In those years I’ve spoken, co\-organized, co\-hosted, and volunteered at conferences and user groups both virtual and in\-person. I’ve worked to bring new sponsors to the PSF through speaking and direct coordination. 


I understand that many organizers and group leaders are experiencing more challenges away from work and code. Many of my recent talks step away from coding and address supporting topics such as career\-changing, mental health, and neurodiversity. I’ve also connected with conference and meetup organizers regularly to learn how to best support them as they begin transitioning to in\-person and hybrid events.


I believe the PSF can continue to adapt to the many new industries, communities, and technologies that have blossomed around Python. If elected, I hope to continue the positive progress in encouraging new and diverse voices. 


I also hope to empower new faces to get involved faster and easier than ever with mentorship and support! This involves pushing for new types of events to create safe ways to connect with Pythonistas in formats comfortable to them.


Finally, I hope my background in content creation can also expand the PSF’s reach to those who aren’t yet prepared to meet in person and hope to still connect with others.
