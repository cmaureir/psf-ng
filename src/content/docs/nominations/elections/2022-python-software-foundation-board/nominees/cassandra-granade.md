Throughout my 15\-year career in quantum computing, Python has been an immense resource for research, for creating and running quantum programs, and for exploring quantum mechanics. Python has helped me to teach scientific computing skills to research students, to write books that introduce quantum computing to new communities, and to collaborate on libraries like QInfer, InstrumentKit, QuTiP, and QCoDeS that help enable quantum computing research.


I would love the opportunity to share what Iâ€™ve learned on this journey to help make Python an even better choice for scientific programming, and to learn from others working to make the Python community even more inclusive and empowering.
