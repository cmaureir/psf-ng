Hello Everyone,


I hope you and your loved ones are doing well and safe.


## About Me


I am Gajendra Deshpande and I am using Python since 2013 for academic research and development activities. I develop prototypes and applications in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Cyber Security, and Web applications using Python and its ecosystem. I am working as a faculty of Computer Science and run a start\-up in cyber security. I am an active member of the PyCon India community and served as program committee lead for PyCon India 2021\. I have presented approximately 80 talks, 20 Workshops, and 15 posters across the globe at prestigious conferences like PyData Global, PyCon APAC, PyCon AU, EuroPython, DjangoCon US and Europe, SciPy India, SciPy USA, PyCon USA, JuliaCon, FOSDEM, and several other Python and FOSS conferences. I have helped Python and FOSS Conferences by reviewing the talk and tutorial proposals, mentoring first\-time speakers, participating in the discussions, and organizing the events. I am passionate about community work and would love to continue contributing to the Python community. I believe that as a member of the PSF board I can contribute to the community more effectively.

## Goals as a PSF board member (2022 \- 2025\)


* Start student chapters and professional chapters to spread awareness about Python and Open Source Projects. Introduce more people to the Python community and facilitate them to become contributors to the community in various capacities such as Speakers, Volunteers, and Core Python developers.
* Work as a facilitator to start more regional Python conferences and City level chapters in the Global South. I started the BelPy conference in 2021 which is a regional conference in Belagavi, India. I have Initiated the organization of Django conference and grow it to DjangoCon in ASIA region like DjangoCon US and DjangoCon EU. The Django Conference is in the planning stage and will be organized in the last week of October or the first week of November.
* Work with industries to develop Python courses and enable the adoption of industry\-aligned Python courses in Universities and colleges. These courses can be offered as a part of the curriculum wherever possible or as add\-on courses. The goal is to make more people employable in a short time using the “Train\-to\-Deploy” approach. The courses shall be made affordable to the Python community and especially for those who are suffering from economic hardships.
* Work with start\-ups for adoption of Python in product development thereby encourage them to contribute towards and Python community and PSF.
* Create awareness among people regarding the activities of PSF, Python conferences, Projects, and grants. Motivate and mentor people from diverse backgrounds to apply for grants and projects.
* Study the financial models of other technical communities and non\-profit organizations and adopt proven and innovative ideas for sustainability.
* Work with present PSF board members and actively contribute to the Python community.
