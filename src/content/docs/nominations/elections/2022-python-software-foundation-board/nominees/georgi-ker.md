Hi I’m Georgi, I’m a fellow member and a mother of 2 teenage kids. I received the PSF Community Service award in Q4 2020 and this is the first time I’m running for the board of Directors.
The Python community is not only people who help improve the language and packages, but also people behind the backstage organising meet\-ups, conferences, or forums. I belong to the 2nd group.
I speak 8 different languages and code as a hobby. Being a novice in Python, I don’t give talks on 101 Python tips and tricks but I contribute to what I’m good at: design, project managing, marketing and events. I learn when developers give their talks and share their experiences in events I help create. Contributing as a volunteer is never a bed of roses. But the Python community has always been extremely helpful and supportive. Many successes would not have happened without these friends.
Being an immigrant living in several countries, a woman over 40 with no CS certification, a lefty with atypical learning path, an ex\-teacher for students with mental disabilities, I also advocate for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.


Below is an overview of my contributions to the community \-

### Goals as a board member:


**Expanding awareness about PSF membership**
During the year leading PyCon APAC, I realised that many developers and active community leaders (outside EU and US) were either not PSF members or have not even heard of the PSF membership. I hope to continue drawing more awareness to the works of the PSF to regions of active Python developers similar to the membership campaign created in Thailand where all 14 of the PyCon APAC organising team signed up as members to help push the membership drive.


**Create a more diverse and inclusive Python ecosystem**
Although the most number of Python users comes from Asia, Africa and South America, the current votes and seats in the PSF board are not projecting a balanced and healthy geographical representation. I hope to help create a more welcoming environment for a diversified community just like how Python is spread around the world.


**Create lower learning curve for new contributors to the Python language, packages and infrastructure around the community.**
Attending PyCon US 2022 in\-person and interacting with core developers and active community leaders has given me a clearer perspective on the future of Python. I look forward to contributing in this aspect and help encourage more new contributors from different aspects.


**Create accessibility to welfare for Python community**
Python community thrives not only because the language is versatile, but also because of the humanity among the contributors in the community. While the language is what brought everyone together, people is the key to the growth and sustainability of the community. I believe by creating easier accessibility for those who need positive encouragement, mental support, guidance, and empathy could reinforce PSF and the future of Python.


Finally, I hope if elected, my presence on the board will encourage more under\-represented Python contributors and community leaders to step up in future.
