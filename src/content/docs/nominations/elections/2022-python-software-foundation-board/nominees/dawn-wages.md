## I am a community\-taught developer and Python engineer of 7 years.


Doing justice to my entire software journey, it started back around 2005\. I treasured my time on MySpace — adding media players and backgrounds affects to profile. I began learning in the open and never stopped. Years later, after realizing the world of finance wasn’t my road, I came back to tech as a SQL Analyst then Marketing Analyst, Project Manager, Python and Django Consultant, Open Source Core Team member and Research Analyst — never straying far from my desire to learn and share in the open.


## I learn and mentor in the open with Open Source.


I am a proud product of the DjangoCon community, the annual Django Conference, and have devoted my time to DjangoCon US and EU in various roles since 2018 — mostly on Sponsor teams — through which I’ve been an active participant in the day\-to\-day ways individuals and organizations invest back into our larger Python body as well as reckoning with the practicalities of funding the budget of a software community. Django Girls and mentoring has remained close to my heart. I’ve held several more Django Girls events including the Django Girls coming to DjangoCon 2022, since my first Django Girls as an attendee in 2016\. 


## I am a steward of my communities and contribute to tools that help members feel seen and safe.


I am a Python tool\-maker with and for Python tool\-makers. Many code and no\-code solutions have revolved around improving the developer experience of Python software contribution. Specifically with the Wagtail CMS organizing team, I am one to raise my hand when there is work to be done. I have helped organize [Wagtail Space](https://us.wagtail.space/) since 2018 — the conference for the Django\-based Python CMS called Wagtail, given conference talks, participate in working groups and mentored in formal and informal settings. I try to make coding fun and approachable. I do similar work to a greater extent in some respects for the Organization for Ethical Source and At The Root — two groups dedicated to Ethical Source Licenses, Django Girls, and DjangoCon.


## I am thrilled to continue helping with the day\-to\-day responsibilities in the Python community.


Doing “the work” comes in the form of hundreds of emails, dozens of PRs and comments, core team votes, press releases and hundreds of contracts over the years. I’m focused on work that keeps the “trains running on time” and provides new modes of transportation (to extend the metaphor) with the Python community.


## Goals


* Create ways for Black, Brown, Indigenous, gender\-marginalized, disabled and queer people to participate in the open source community using existing patterns that have already proven successful including, but not limited to: apprenticeships, hack\-a\-thons, formal mentoring, video stream events tailored to safe communities, first\-time contributor series, documentation, etc. For each intersection, future Pythonistas require representation and space show up fully.
* Generate sustainable models for Python Software Foundation workgroups to push the initiatives forward.
* Increase Python Working Group engagement.
* Increase the number of Python Sprint events.
* Create thoughtful, sustainable solutions for PSF’s financial security.


It would be a great privilege to give back to the community that has already given so much to me.
