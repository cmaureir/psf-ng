I am a Geek turned Entrepreneur, Angel Investor, Startup Advisor, and Mentor. I am also the founder and curator of Python Weekly, one of the most popular weekly newsletters for Python. For over ten years now, I have kept the Python community up to date with what's happening in the Python world via Python Weekly. I have met/connected with many exceptional Python engineers through my work with Python Weekly. In addition, I built my previous startup using Python. I am super connected and very active in the startup world and continuously advocate the use of Python and various related technologies to the founders and builders.
