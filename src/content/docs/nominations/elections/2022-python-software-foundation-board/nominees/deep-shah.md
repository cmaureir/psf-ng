I became involved with the Python community 3 years ago while pursuing a Computer Engineering bachelor’s degree at NMIMS Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management and Engineering, Mumbai in India. 


When I joined the Python community I couldn’t believe how welcoming and friendly everyone was. My experience helped me stay in tech and since then my goal has been to welcome others into the community in the same way.
In the years since I’ve been involved in the Python community as a developer, teacher, mentor, and conference and event organizer and have spent a significant amount of time volunteering. I mentored a lot of students in my colleges to get into the world of Python programming.


I've had the opportunity to teach others by speaking at various online/offline meetups around the world when the Covid\-19 hit up. My goal with talks has always been to take topics that may seem complex or unapproachable to beginners and break them down to make the concepts clear for Python developers at any level. I was also a nominee for the 2021 Python Software Foundation Board Election.


As a member of the PSF board, I’d like to focus on the following areas:


We need to build remote communities, create engaging events and have opportunities to collaborate on open source projects via sprints in a way that spans borders and timezones. I’d also like to help the PSF navigate this issue from a financial aspect given a decrease in funding from canceled in\-person events worldwide. My experience with streaming, recording and speaking at online conferences as co\-chair will help me achieve these goals.


Second, as a mentor, I'd like to bring my experience to the table to help the PSF continue to support new and diverse perspectives in our ecosystem. We need to ensure we can provide adequate support and online mentorship opportunities remotely, be able to welcome a new set of open source contributors, support those who speak other languages with translations, and ensure that remote events are accessible by exploring opportunities and funding to provide captions and follow other accessibility\-friendly best practices. We need representation to ensure the Python community remains welcoming to everyone even as we move online. I’d like to form or strengthen working groups to achieve these goals
