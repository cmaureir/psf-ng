I am a public interest technologist working for Sunet (Swedish University Computer Network). I actively participate in various Python communities, including PSF grants working group. I used to be one of the communication officers of the PSF board. I was also conference staff of the PyCon US and part of other Pycons in various forms.


I spent my life in different FOSS communities, both professionally \& personally. I am a CPython core developer, a fellow at PSF, and part of the [Tor Project core team](https://www.torproject.org/). I also contributed to the Fedora Project for over 16 years. I help to maintain [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org), which is an open\-source whistleblower submission system (written in Python) that media organizations and NGOs can install to securely accept documents from anonymous sources.


Goals for the board in 2022:


* To continue building up the Python community worldwide and connecting people to the Python Software Foundation. I have a unique opportunity as I recently moved to Sweden and became part of the Python communities in both Asia \& Europe actively. I want to ensure that the PSF board has the input from the rest of the world (than the majority of the board members). I hope my experience working in both non\-profit \& public sectors will bring a different perspective to the board.
* To focus on the smaller active Python communities (PyLadies groups especially, \& other groups focused on particular use cases) and ensure they get the support as required. Part of this is about working as a bridge for these communities \& bringing in the members from the same groups into the upstream groups.
* To refocus on the grants work group activities. The post\-COVID world is different. Now, as a community, we can do much more with grants and related online activities around the world (as online events have become a norm in the last few years).
* Helping out in the regular activities of the PSF as required.
