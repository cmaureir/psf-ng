I'm KwonHan in South Korea 
me and other people include younggun started PyCon Korea and Python User Group in Korea since 2014\.
every year PyCon KR's attendee increased and at 2016 PyCon KR team hold PyCon APAC 2016 with about 1500 people, 3 days full conference event. 
also we adopted ChildCare, O.S.T and code for kids.
at 2019, exnted to 4 days event include tutorials and sprint.
before covid\-19, KR team had about 10K people to attend PyCon KR. 


as holding more conferences, I think we need to increase diversity in python community to meet more people with python.
