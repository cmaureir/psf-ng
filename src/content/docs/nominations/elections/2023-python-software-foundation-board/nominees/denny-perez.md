## Introduction


I'm Denny Perez. My journey in the Python community began five years ago when I attended PyCon US in Cleveland in 2018\. As a professional accountant with over ten years of experience, I decided to change careers when I immigrated to Canada and immersed myself in the exciting world of Python programming.


As a PSF Fellow and a mother of three, I have learned that the Python community is not only made up of programmers and developers who enhance the packages but also of people behind the scenes who organize conferences, meetups, and workshops. I belong to this second group. Although I am a beginner in Python, my contribution focuses on project management, marketing, events, and community management. I learn from developers while they give talks and share their experiences at the events I help create. Volunteering is challenging, but the Python community has always been an invaluable support. Many of the successes I have achieved in my career would not have been possible without the valuable support of my friends and collaborators. I have been an unwavering advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout my work. I firmly believe in creating environments where all individuals, regardless of their background, gender, or ability, have equal opportunities to participate and thrive.


## Contributions to the Python Community


Over the past five years, I have worked hard to empower the Spanish\-speaking community in various countries. Since 2019, I have been involved with different Python\-related groups and activities. As the founder of the "Chicas en Programación Mtl" [group](https://discord.gg/cXp8qP8v), I organized in\-person events and mentored Python from scratch to Latinas in Montreal. Although the pandemic slowed down the group, I sought other initiatives to help and joined as a [Python en Español](https://hablemospython.dev/) Discord Server coordinator. This community aims to bring together Spanish speakers of Python.


I have volunteered at various Python conferences in different roles, including PyCon US 2018 and 2019 (PyLadies booth and auction), PyCon Latam 2019 (host and volunteer team coordinator), PyCon Canada 2019 (registration and swag), Python Brasil 2021 (host and session organizer), PyCon US 2021 (PyCharlas chat room moderator), and PyCascades 2022 (chat room moderator).


Additionally, I have had the opportunity to speak at numerous events and conferences, such as Python Panamá, Python Nicaragua, Python Dominicana, Python Bolivia, PyCon Brasil, and PyCon US.


In addition to my involvement in the Python en Español Discord Server, I have been a co\-organizer of [PyCon Latam](https://www.pylatam.org/) since 2020 and a co\-organizer of the [Python Chile](https://pythonchile.cl/index.html) community (where I helped establish the first PyCon Chile in 2021\). Since last year, I have been the Co\-chair of the [PyCon Charlas](https://us.pycon.org/2023/speaking/charlas/) Track at PyCon US, the community manager of the [SciPy Latam](https://t.co/119eF6GCdX) conference in Argentina, and the Volunteer Chair at [PyCascades](https://2023.pycascades.com/). This year, I started collaborating as a co\-organizer of [PyJamas Conf](https://pyjamas.live/).


### PyLadies Community


In the PyLadies community, I co\-founded the first chapter in Chile, [PyLadies Santiago](https://maureira.xyz/pyladieschile/), established in 2021\. I have also collaborated as a co\-founder in two other PyLadies chapters, which I am currently coordinating: PyLadies en Español, a chapter specifically created to empower people throughout Latin America and Spain to grow as a Spanish\-speaking community, and PyLadies [Santo Domingo](https://twitter.com/Pyladies_SDQ). Additionally, I lead a community within the Python en Español Discord Server called ["Casi Viernes con PyLadies"](https://gh.io/casiviernes) (Almost Friday with PyLadies). This space gathers every Thursday to share knowledge on creating communities around the Python programming language while learning more about the PyLadies community. My ultimate goal is to expand the network of PyLadies chapters throughout Latin America and Spain, providing more opportunities and support to women interested in programming.


## Objectives as a Board Member


As a member of the Board of Directors of the Python Software Foundation, I have clear and defined goals to continue contributing to the growth and strengthening of the community.


The objectives of my candidacy focus on four main ideas:


### International Advocacy for the PSF


Improve the official PSF blog to other communities with active communities translating the documentation, like the Spanish group, to help with the official blog posts to increase the visibility of "local heroes" in the Python community. These new posts will highlight developers' success stories and achievements, inspiring others, with the primary objective to bring the PSF closer to our members.


Create a platform for non\-English speakers and Python content creators to showcase their work and promote their publications on social media platforms like YouTube, expanding their exposure and reach and having a community\-based moderation team to verify the content adheres to the PSF code of conduct.


### Engaging Students


Redefine the role of Python Ambassador and develop programs to actively involve students, fostering their participation in the Python community.


Collaborate with educational institutions to promote Python and provide resources that enable students to learn and engage with the language. This will be achieved by:


* Gather interested PSF members to give informational and language talks at Universities
* Provide feedback to students on program content
* Notify about conference opportunities and other activities
* Inform about the options communities have with regards to the PSF help


### Strengthening Collaboration with PyLadies


Foster a strong and collaborative relationship between PyLadies and the PSF, working directly with the global PyLadies council.


Encourage PyLadies chapters worldwide to become more involved in PSF programs and working groups, thus contributing to the growth and development of the Python ecosystem. This can be achieved by:


* Open global calls
* Language\-based calls for ongoing chapters
* Questions and Answers sessions for new interested chapters,
* Empower other diversity initiatives like Women in Tech, Django Girls, etc.


### Establishing i18n recommended practices


After the success of many language translations for the Python documentation and a few other resources, it’s time for us as PSF to define workflows and recommendations for new teams of people, so they can have the necessary information for translating material, including the documentation.


I would like to connect communities like the French and Spanish to define a proposal for i18n good practices for documentation. I would also use this knowledge to extend the possibilities for translating the leading Python site and other critical resources like the profound blog.


This will ensure communities in every corner of the world have the basis and a team of people to start exposing resources in their cultures and languages.


## Conclusion


In summary, as a member of the Board of Directors of the PSF, I am committed to providing opportunities to the Python community and working tirelessly to achieve greater diversity, equity, and inclusion. I firmly believe in creating environments where all individuals, regardless of their background, gender, or ability, have equal opportunities to participate and thrive. I am ready to take on this challenge and make a meaningful contribution to the growth and continued success of the Python community.
