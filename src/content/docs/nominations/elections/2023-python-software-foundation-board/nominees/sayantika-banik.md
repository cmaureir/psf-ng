### About me 👩🏽‍🎨


👋🏽 I am Sayantika (she/her), based out of India. I find joy in embracing various passions, from exploring technology and open source to expressing myself through art and caring for my little plants. I learn through interconnected experiences.


### My community journey 🫶🏽


Right from the very beginning, my tech journey has been exhilarating, weaving together diverse experiences.


Diversity and inclusion hold a special place in my heart. I have had the privilege of being involved in the **Diversity and Inclusion Work Group** at the Python Software Foundation (PSF), where we strive to create an inclusive Python community by amplifying diverse voices and advocating for equitable opportunities.


As a founding committee member at **NumFocus's Project Incubator**, I enjoyed brainstorming and witnessing the power of open\-source collaboration and mentorship.


**PyLadies Bangalore** has always been close to my heart. Starting as a community member, I have grown exponentially through my journey to becoming an organizer.


In the past, I had the privilege of serving as a workgroup member at **RSE Asia**, where I furthered my knowledge and explored the friendly research software engineering community.


I am also proud to have served as a Board Member at the **Django Software Foundation**, actively shaping a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem for Django developers.


Contributing as a reviewer for the **Tapia** 2020/2021 conference scholarships gave me a unique perspective on the remarkable achievements and potential of underrepresented groups in computing.


Each experience has added a unique piece to the puzzle of my personal growth.
