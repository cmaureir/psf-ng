Hi! I’m Christopher Neugebauer. I’m a Queer Australian living in Northern California. I currently serve on the PSF Grants Working Group, and as director of the North Bay Python conference here in Petaluma. I previously served on the PSF Board between 2018 and 2021\.


I have a track record of building diverse communities, and spending time working directly with fellow board members to help make the foundation do better work. That said, I have specific things I want to accomplish too. 


If elected, I want to focus on the following:


1. More effectively using the Grants program as a tool for outreach
2. Building stronger partnerships with regional and international Python conferences to further the PSF’s mission


### Grants:


I’ve served on the Grants Working Group since it was founded in 2015, and over the last year, have been a source of institutional knowledge as the Grants program has resumed since shutting down at the start of the Pandemic. 


I see our Grants program as the easiest way for the Foundation to achieve its mission of growing the international Python community. We enable local volunteers to do great work.


Now that the program is running at close to the capacity it was in 2019 again, I want to serve on the board to help guide our Grant\-giving strategy: I want to focus on ensuring our grants are impactful, ensuring that our money grows a diverse and international Python community, or that our grants help further the reach of the PSF.


### Regional conferences


Our community has done a good job of building up regional and national conferences all over the world, and we’re starting to see more conferences come back from their Pandemic\-enforced break.


The PSF runs PyCon US, which has an outsized influence on other Python conferences, in the US, but also abroad. I’d like to help the PSF better work with regional conferences: traditionally the PSF has not done a good job of sharing sponsorship resources or infrastructure (both financial and technical). I’ll use my time on the board to help build relationships with conferences, seek opportunities to pool funding opportunities, and prioritize projects to make it easier for Python events to benefit from our infrastructure and ability to attract interest from larger companies.


In return, I’d like to see regional conferences be a resource the Foundation can better rely on when PyCon US can’t effectively serve our entire community, for reasons within our control — for example, providing opportunities if PyCon US becomes capacity\-restricted again — or out of our control — for example, if a PyCon US venue again unexpectedly becomes unsafe or inaccessible for marginalized members of our community ([as it did in Utah for 2023](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2023/02/response-to-utahs-transgender.html)). Regional conferences can help us keep our community welcoming, even if circumstances out of our control make the Foundation less so. I want to lead the Foundation in building up that capacity.


I want to continue growing our community, and I want to be able to welcome more people as our community grows.


I’ve been an effective Board Member in the past, and I am excited to request your vote, so I can do this important work.
