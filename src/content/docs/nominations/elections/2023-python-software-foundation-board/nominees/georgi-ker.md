### I'm Georgi Ker,


I am running for the board again this year. Why am I running again? Well, it's simple. the board is missing something crucial – a voice for the APAC community. The PyCon APAC community is massive and I've been listening to the community, and that's why I'm here, ready to talk the talk and walk the walk.
And as long as I don't see a member from this corner of the globe, I'll keep raising my hand.


Currently, I may be living in Amsterdam, enjoying the perks of legal weed, fabulous pride celebrations, and affordable education for my kids, my heart still beats to the rhythm of Asia. 


Let me clear up a few things about myself. I'm not a core developer, and I don't hold a fancy BA, MA, or PhD. I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth, and I'm definitely not the top scorer in any domain. None of that stops me from wanting to make a real difference.
