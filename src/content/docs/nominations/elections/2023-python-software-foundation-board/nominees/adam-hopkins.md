Dear Python Community,


I am excited to announce my self\-nomination for a position on the Board of the Python Software Foundation (PSF). As a dedicated member of the Python community and an advocate for open\-source software (OSS), I am committed to contributing my skills, experience, and passion to further advance the Python programming language and support its vibrant ecosystem.


## Qualifications and Experience


### Deep Involvement in the Python Community


* **25\+ years of experience:** I have been actively involved with Python for over two decades, witnessing its growth and evolution.
* **Python expertise:** I am a Python expert with a strong command of the language's fundamentals and advanced concepts.
* **Contributor and maintainer:** I have made significant contributions to the Python community through my participation in mailing lists, forums, and GitHub repositories. I have also maintained several open\-source projects, helping to foster collaboration and innovation.
* **Tech conferences and speaking engagements:** As an active speaker at tech conferences, I have had the privilege of sharing my knowledge and insights on Python with the community. I believe in the power of knowledge sharing to promote growth and learning. I have been honored to be asked to speak as the keynote speaker at PyCon IL this Summer.


### Dedication to Open\-Source Software


* **Advocate for open\-source philosophy:** I firmly believe in the principles of open\-source software and its transformative impact on technology and society. I actively promote the adoption and use of open\-source software in various forums.
* **Open\-source contributions:** Beyond Python, I have contributed to numerous other open\-source projects, allowing me to gain valuable experience and insights into collaborative development processes.
* **Published author:** I have authored a book on web development, emphasizing the importance of open\-source tools and frameworks. This experience has given me a deep appreciation for the role of documentation in enabling wider adoption and growth within the Python community.


### Leadership and Community Building

## Vision and Goals


If elected to the Board of the Python Software Foundation, I will focus on the following key areas:


1. **Community growth and inclusivity:** I will work to foster a diverse and inclusive Python community, creating opportunities for underrepresented groups and promoting a welcoming environment for newcomers. I do this already within the Sanic community, and I would like to bring this experience to the PSF.
2. **Education and outreach:** I aim to enhance educational resources and initiatives that promote Python as a powerful tool for learning programming and problem\-solving.
3. **Supporting open\-source projects:** I will advocate for resources and funding to support the development of critical open\-source projects and initiatives within the Python ecosystem.
4. **Collaboration and partnerships:** I will seek to strengthen relationships with other organizations, academic institutions, and industry partners to foster collaboration and drive innovation.
5. **Transparency and governance:** I will promote transparency and effective governance within the PSF, ensuring that decisions are made with the best interests of the community in mind.
