Hello, I am Cheuk. My origin is from Hong Kong, I moved to the United Kingdom in 2016 and discovered Python and the community while I was changing my career into Data Science the year after. I finished school with an MPhil. in Physics. During my university years, I have been running student associations and have been a student union council member for 2 years.


After discovering the Python community, I have been active in community work, including organising meetups and conferences. In 2021 and 2022, I served in the EuroPython Society as a board member. In 2021, I became a Python Software Foundation fellow.


Events that I have organised/co\-organised:


* EuroPython (one of the biggest European conferences)
* Pyjamas (global 24\-hour online conference)
* Mentored Sprints (encourage contribution to open\-source, especially from folks from marginalised groups)
* PyData London and Global (conferences with a data science focus)


I have also volunteered at various conferences including PyCon US and PyCon APAC.


Besides events, I have also co\-founded Humble Data Workshop, a workshop inspired by Django Girls, which aims to encourage under\-represented folks to learn Python and apply it in data analysis work. This year, I have organised in\-person Humble Data workshops in Namibia and Colombia to support the local Python community.


In recent years, I have been learning Spanish and Japanese to connect with the community that speaks those languages dominantly. I have given a lighting talk in Spanish at PyCon ES in 2022\.


Besides all the community work, I have also contributed to Python open\-source projects including pandas, hypotheses and Django.

## Why do I want to join the Python Software Foundation Board?


As a member of the Python community, I feel a responsibility and excitement in supporting the day\-to\-day operations of the community. Including ensuring that it is a safe, inclusive and welcoming environment; encouraging representation of people from various backgrounds to become part of the community; and raising funds to support the needs of the community.


I have participated and will keep on participating in various Python events globally to meet and bring everyone together. Nothing gives me more joy than meeting and talking to people and seeing how I can help the community. I am overcoming the language barriers by learning multiple languages, for example, there is a huge Spanish\-speaking community that I would like to connect to.


## How I can contribute to the Python Software Foundation Board?


Having the mission of promoting Python and the community in mind. I have created workshops and events that encourage learning Python for absolute beginners. I am also organising online events to lower the entry barrier for the Python community.


To inspire the participation of under\-represented folks I would like to highlight and celebrate the work and contributions of various forms, like documentation and community\-building contributions from the under\-represented groups.


Besides the Board member responsibilities, I would also like to be part of the Diversity and Inclusion Work Group, Grants Work Group and Packaging Work Group


## Why I am a suitable Python Software Foundation Board member?


With my experience serving the EuroPython Society board, I understand the responsibility of being a board member and have experience working with volunteers and other community members. I have also been working with the Python Software Foundation staff during PyCon US, and we have good working relationships. 


On top of that, I have undertaken code of conduct training and fully understand the importance of having a diverse and welcoming community. I will fully comply with the code of conduct of the Python Software Foundation at all times. 


I am a person that will stick to my commitments; during my term on the EuroPython Society board I rarely skip any board meetings and if I do I will provide a good reason. I will not make easy promises if I don’t think I can make it because when I take on a responsibility I am very serious about it. After being an active member of the Python community for 7 years, I am ready to serve as a Python Software board member for the entire term.
