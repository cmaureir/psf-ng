### 2021 Bylaws Proposed Changes Election


The following resolutions were approved:


#### Section 5\.15 Limits on Co\-affiliation of Board Members


Resolution approved by the board of directors



> RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation board approve the bylaw implementation of 'Section 5\.15\. Limits on Co\-affiliation of Board Members' as proposed [here](https://github.com/VanL/psf-bylaws/compare/9666a3a397c30fa7c03526a413e28a3bcbd02462...limits-on-affiliation), to be voted on by the membership during the next election.


#### Context


The board is focused on promoting a diverse and international community. Many directors work at organizations that are part of our community, sponsor the PSF, and/or volunteer in some other way. It happens occasionally that several board members are employed by the same organization, and this shouldn’t be an impediment for their service. At the same time the Board wants to guard against a situation where a single entity has complete control over the PSF by gaining a majority of the board seats. It’s not quite enough to declare allegiances and let voting members decide who to elect, because for example one company taking over another could result in a majority on the Board. The Bylaw changes aim to prevent such Board capture.


### Section 4\.8\. Fellows


Resolution approved by the board of directors



> RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation board approve the bylaw updates to 'Section 4\.8\. Fellows' as proposed [here](https://github.com/VanL/psf-bylaws/compare/9666a3a397c30fa7c03526a413e28a3bcbd02462...24a5abbde0b938492f6dcdaa5781388b9932fa72), to be voted on by the membership during the next election.


#### Context



+ The PSF Board noticed that the current bylaws lacked the ability for the board to fully delegate Fellow approvals to the Fellows Work Group.
Going forward, the board prefers an option to empower the WG (which is composed of only Fellow members) to accept nominations, vote on them, and officially approve them.
+ If these changes are approved, the pull request will be made against the official bylaw repository.
