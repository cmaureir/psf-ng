## Voting Memberships


As core stakeholders of the Python Software Foundation community, Supporting Members, Managing \& Contributing Members, and PSF Fellows are all eligible to vote in [PSF Board Elections](/nominations/elections/).


### 1\. **[Sign up as a Supporting Member here!](https://psfmember.org/python-software-foundation-supporting-member-2/)**


Supporting Members donate an annual membership fee of $99 to the PSF to sustain the Foundation and support the Python community. We have also introduced a sliding scale rate for Supporting Membership, which [you can sign up for here](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&id=39). Your support is crucial to the PSF's ability to do our work making Python available and supporting our community.
