The Python Software Foundation needs your help building infrastructure for
the PSF and PyCon US, helping with fundraising and advocacy, and running important
parts of the Python community (mailing lists, website, job board, etc).


You can help out by signing up the **psf\-volunteers** mailing list, which
puts you in a pool of people that receive requests from the PSF board when
there is work to be done that we cannot handle ourselves.


[Sign up here](http://python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-volunteers)!


Don't worry if you won't always be available. Our goal is to build a pool
of volunteers so that work can get be done by whomever is available at the
time of need. This will help get things done with fewer delays.



# Example Tasks


* Help find donors and sponsors
* Act as a PSF representative at a conference
* Do a mini\-presentation on the PSF at your local users group
* Help with other initiatives, such as grants
* [Participate in planning and organizing PyCon US](/psf/volunteer/pycon/)




# Python Software Foundation Working Groups


We also have PSF working groups comprised of volunteers. [See the list of active working groups here](http://www.python.org/psf/workgroups). Please note that not all working groups are currently accepting new volunteers.
