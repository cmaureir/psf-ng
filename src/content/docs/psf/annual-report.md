# 


2022 was a year of continued changes, challenges, and growth for the PSF. 


We welcomed Deb Nicholson as our new Executive Director, and we brought on other new team members and new roles. We joyfully gathered back together for the first PyCon US in\-person since 2019\. We created new membership options growing our pool of active and engaged members, and we gave out $215K in Grants in 2022, a 45% increase over 2021\. We were delighted to welcome the global network of PyLadies chapters into our fiscal sponsor program. 


We’d love for you to take a look at the 2022 Annual Report that we put together to share more highlights from the year, financial reporting, and some previews of what’s to come in the next year.
