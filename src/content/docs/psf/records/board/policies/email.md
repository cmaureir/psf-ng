# 



Use of @python.org email addresses represents the Python Software Foundation. The PSF maintains an email policy to help users understand the expectations for usage of their @python.org address.


@python.org emails can be assigned to the following:


* Python Software Foundation staff
* Python Software Foundation board members and officers
* Python core developers
* Python community mailing lists
* Significant contributors to Python infrastructure and services


Those that have been given an @python.org email address agree to follow these rules:


* All communication via the email address should be in accordance with our [code of conduct](/psf/codeofconduct/) and ethical behavior.
* This email alias should not be used for personal benefit. For example, those that use their @python.org email to solicit work for their Python consulting work violate this rule. This can be interpreted as a PSF endorsement of a private business, which we do not allow.


Violations of any of the above, may result in revocation of a users @python.org address.
