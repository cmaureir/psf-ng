# Python Software Foundation Conflict of Interest Policy for Board of Directors


**What is a conflicts of interest?** A potential conflict of interest occurs anytime you, your friends, family, or an organization you participate in stands to gain from a decision that is being made by the PSF (and specifically by the board). Possible conflicts of interest should be considered broadly. The highest standards of ethics apply for all PSF members, officers, and directors.


**What to do about conflicts of interest:** Possible conflicts of interest should be disclosed to all decision\-makers prior to any action being taken. You should also provide a full description of the way in which you (or someone connected to you) may financially benefit from the decision that is being considered. This disclosure should be in writing or on the record so that there is appropriate documentation.


**Discussing options:** In discussing the possible outcomes of board decisions, always make sure to keep your conflict of interest present in your mind and, as appropriate, included as a disclaimer to any comments you make. It is your duty to act in the best interests of the PSF regardless of the conflict. It is inappropriate to advocate privately for decisions that would benefit you when a conflict of interest is present \- your actions should all be on the record.


**Recusing yourself from votes:** You may recuse yourself from votes if you have a conflict of interest, but it is not required so long as the conflict of interest has been fully disclosed and recorded. Any policy that passes must pass by a majority of the disinterested directors.


This policy is included as a supplement to and explanation of your duties under Section 5\.13\. Director Conflicts of Interest from the Bylaws (included below). It is your responsibility to fully comply with both.
