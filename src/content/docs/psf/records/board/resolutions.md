> **RESOLVED**, that the Python Software Foundation award the Q1 2019 Community Service Award to Stefan Behnel for his work as the main developer and maintainer of two important Python projects: Cython and lxml. Stefan forked off Pyrex and started Cython almost 11 years ago. Cython makes writing and maintain a C extension or C library bindings simple. It plays a vital role in the numeric and scientific community, too. Without Cython, Python 3 adoption would have taken much longer. Cython hides much of the Python 2 / 3 C\-API differences from the developer. <https://pypi.org/project/Cython/> lxml is the fastest and most feature rich XML parsing, transforming and querying package for Python. It's also commonly used to parse HTML. <https://pypi.org/project/lxml/> Stefan has been maintaining these two important libraries for over a decade. He is also a regular speaker at conferences and very helpful on the mailing lists.

> In order to
> 
> 
> 1. Clarify the purpose of the PSF to current and potential members
> and donors, and to the general public;
> 2. Aid in soliciting donations, by affirming the charitable nature
> of the PSF's goals;
> 3. Help guide the Board in its deliberations;
> 4. Get a start on possible changes needed in the PSF's bylaws; and,
> 5. Justify further work on applying for public charity status,
> 
> 
> be it hereby
> 
> 
> **RESOLVED**, that the PSF adopts the following mission statement.
> 
> 
> 
> > The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a non\-profit membership
> > organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the
> > Python programming language. It intends to qualify under the US
> > Internal Revenue Code as a tax\-exempt 501(c)(3\) scientific and
> > educational public charity, and will conduct its business according to
> > the rules for such organizations.
> > 
> > 
> > By "open source" we mean freely available technology licensed under
> > terms compatible with Version 1\.9 (or later) of the Open Source
> > Definition, as established by the Open Source Initiative (see
> > <http://www.opensource.org/>).
> > 
> > 
> > The PSF:
> > 
> > 
> > * Produces the core Python distribution, made available to the public
> > free of charge. This includes the Python language itself, its
> > standard libraries and documentation, installers, source code,
> > educational materials, and assorted tools and applications.
> > * Establishes PSF licenses, ensuring the rights of the public to freely
> > obtain, use, redistribute, and modify intellectual property held by
> > the PSF.
> > * Works with the Open Source Initiative to ensure that PSF licenses
> > conform to the Open Source Definition.
> > * Holds Python's intellectual property rights for releases 2\.1 and
> > following.
> > * Seeks to obtain the intellectual property rights for Python releases
> > prior to 2\.1, for relicensing under the PSF Python license, to relieve
> > the legal burden on Python's users. The PSF may also seek rights
> > to other Python\-related software for relicensing under a PSF license.
> > * Protects the Python name, and the names, service marks and trademarks
> > associated with all other intellectual property held by the PSF.
> > * Solicits and manages contributions to the Python codebase, and may
> > perform these services on behalf of other open source Python\-related
> > codebases.
> > * Raises funds to support PSF programs and services. The regulations
> > for public charity funding are complex. Some consequences are that
> > the vast bulk of funding must come from private contributions
> > (including sponsoring memberships) and public grants, must come from
> > a broad base, and that no single private donor can supply a
> > substantial percentage of the PSF's total funding. Additional
> > revenue may be pursued in ways consistent with then\-current rules for
> > public charities and with Python's standing as an open source project.
> > For example, the PSF may offer to sell conference proceedings, special
> > Python distributions, or merchandise with distinctive insignia.
> > * Publicizes, promotes the adoption of, and facilitates the ongoing
> > development of Python\-related technology and educational resources.
> > This includes, but is not limited to, maintaining a public web site,
> > planning Python conferences, and offering grants to Python\-related
> > open source projects.
> > * Encourages and facilitates Python\-related research in the public
> > interest.
