# 


2021 was a year of continued changes, challenges, and growth for the PSF. 


We said goodbye to our first Executive Director and welcomed four new team members in new roles. We celebrated our 20th anniversary and built on the successes of our first two decades to launch new areas of work that advance our mission and help us to even better serve our Python community. 


We’d love for you to take a look at the 2021 Annual Report that we put together to share some highlights from the year, financial reporting, and some previews of what’s to come in the next year.
