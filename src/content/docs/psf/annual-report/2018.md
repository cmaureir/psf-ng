# 



 The Python Software Foundation is proud to launch our first ever Annual Report.
 We understand the need for transparency and hope to help our community and stakeholders
 find necessary information about the PSF in a single place. 2018 was a year of growth for
 the PSF while still focussing on sustainability for our staff and community.
 We’re excited to share these data points with you!
 




Our staff team increased by two full\-time employees in 2018\.
 We hired a Director of Infrastructure to lead much needed improvements to our internal systems,
 assist our community with PSF hosted services, and support the Python core developers
 with their infrastructure needs. As PyCon continues to grow and require additional resources,
 we’re happy to have hired an Event Manager to work on PyCon year round. Both new employees are very
 familiar with our community and PyCon so we do not doubt that they will have positive impacts within our
 community for many years to come.
 





 In 2018 we spent additional efforts on strengthening our trademarks.
 Since "PyCon" is a trademark of the PSF, we want to ensure that anywhere
 PyCon is happening, the trademark is protected. Our general counsel has helped us
 register the word mark in many places including 30 Countries/Jurisdictions
 covered by the International Trademark treaty as well as
 Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Africa, Taiwan, Uruguay,
 and Venezuela.
 





 We strengthened our Fiscal Sponsorship Program, which we offer to projects that align with our mission.
 Since all of the projects are run by volunteers, the finance and accounting support we provide them through
 this program eases the amount of work they have to put in on their own time.
 We are now in a better place to support regional conferences such as PyCascades and development
 such as the Pallets group, which maintains projects such as Flask and Jinja.
 





 Our Grants Program continues to support Python events all over the world! Not only does our Grants Program help
 us engage newcomers, it also helps us create a diverse community.
 In 2018 approximately $324,000 was paid in grants to recipients in 51 different countries.
 We awarded $59,804 more in grants in 2018 than 2017, a 22\.6% increase in our global community support in just one year.
 





 We’re pleased to continue to support our community and we make an effort to
 listen to what our community needs and improve the support we provide.
 Even though we cannot attend to everyone’s needs in one attempt,
 we will continue to address what our community needs and introduce new ways to support
 the growth of Python.

# Grants by Year

# Growth of Assets by Year






 The PSF will continue to research diversifying revenue streams,
 hiring additional staff, and improving our fundraising efforts,
 which will all affect future financials. We would like to continue to improve
 the services we provide to the community, expand our programs,
 and better support developers. We also need to consider risk mitigating factors
 such as having diverse revenue streams instead of heavily relying on
 PyCon and a financial reserve of at least 1\.5 years (in operating costs).
 This will help ensure the PSF’s viability for the long run.
