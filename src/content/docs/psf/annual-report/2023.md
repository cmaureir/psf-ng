# The Python Software Foundation 2023 Annual Impact Report


 In 2023, we did MORE of a lot to contribute to the impact of our mission. 


 We welcomed Seth Larson, Mike Fiedler, Marisa Comacho, and Marie Nordin, all fulfilling crucial roles in our support of the Python community. We celebrated the 20th anniversary of PyCon US in Salt Lake City, Utah. We were delighted to welcome seven new organizations into our Fiscal Sponsoree Program. And we are excited to share that we awarded $697K through our Grants \& Travel Grants Programs in 2023! 


We’d love for you to take a look at the 2023 Annual Impact Report that we put together to share more highlights from the year, financial reporting, and some previews of what’s to come in the next year.
