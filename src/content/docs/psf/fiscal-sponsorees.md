# 



# At this time, the Python Software Foundation is not accepting new fiscal sponsoree requests.


The Python Software Foundation promotes, protects, and advances the Python programming language and supports and facilitates the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.


Part of that mission includes acting as a fiscal sponsor to mission\-related Python events, groups, and projects. The PSF provides 501(c)(3\) tax\-exempt status to fiscal sponsorees and manages back office issues like cash flow, accounting, budgeting, insurance, and contract/legal support, as well as access to nonprofit discounts.


To learn more about in the PSF's fiscal sponsorship program, [email us](mailto:fiscal-sponsors@python.org)! We will provide you a fiscal sponsorship questionnaire and materials about how the PSF supports fiscal sponsorees. We will also schedule a call to discuss how your event, group, or project fits with the PSF's charitable mission.


Note: we generally do not take new fiscal sponsorship requests the month before and after the annual PyCon US.


The following groups are active fiscal sponsorees:


## Bandit Alt text


[Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) is a prominent open source project that focuses on the field of application security in Python. Developed and maintained by a dedicated community of developers, Bandit is designed to identify and highlight potential security vulnerabilities and weaknesses within Python codebases. As a static code analysis tool, Bandit scans through the source code, leveraging a wide range of security checks and rules to detect common security issues, such as SQL injections, cross\-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and insecure cryptographic implementations..
