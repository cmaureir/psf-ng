# 



The Python Software Foundation is the organization behind the open source Python programming language. We are devoted to creating the conditions for Python and the Python community to grow and thrive.


We fulfill our [mission](/psf/mission/) through these core activities:


# Infrastructure


STRUCTURE AND STABILITY SO THE PYTHON LANGUAGE, ITS CONTRIBUTORS, AND USERS CAN THRIVE.


* [We distribute Python](http://python.org/downloads), free of charge and available to all, for ever.
* We are the stewards of Python intellectual property—We establish PSF licenses, hold intellectual property rights to most Python releases, and protect Python\-related trademarks.
* We put resources behind and help coordinate and improvements to the Python codebase and new Python releases.


# Community


CONNECTION, DIVERSITY, SUPPORT, AND GROWTH FOR ALL WITHIN THE PYTHON COMMUNITY.


* We host [PyCon US](us.pycon.org), the longest running annual event for celebrating, learning about, and coming together around Python.
* We [give grants](python.org/psf/grants) to groups around the world hosting events for and by Pythonistas supporting each other and welcoming newcomers. In 2021 we awarded $117,000 USD for over 129 grants to recipients in 41 different countries.
* We are responsible for establishing, maintaining, and enforcing the [Python Code of Conduct](python.org/codeofconduct), to work towards a Python community that is a safe and welcoming space for all.
* We provide and support resources to attract new Python users and keep the community growing, diverse, and healthy.
* We fiscally sponsor [12 Python\-related community groups, conferences, and projects](/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/)—including PyLadies, PyCascades, and Palletsto allow them to continue their contributions to the community with organizational infrastructure behind them.


# Investing in Python \& Tools


WE BUILD, SUPPORT, AND MAINTAIN CRITICAL PUBLIC GOODs FOR THE PYTHON COMMUNITY.


* We host [PyPI](pypi.org), the Python package repository relied on by thousands of users with a huge range of projects. We've brought on board a Packaging Project Manager to best serve PyPI users
* We've added a full\-time CPython Developer in Residence to our team, who amplifies volunteer contributors’ impact by processing CPython pull requests and tackling structural improvements.
