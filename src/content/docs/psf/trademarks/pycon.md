*Version 1\.0*



# "PyCon" Trademark Policy


In order to protect the term "PyCon" against unwanted or misleading
use by third parties, the PSF claims the term “PyCon” as a trademark
worldwide for conference activities. The PSF is additionally pursuing
registration of the mark in various jurisdictions.


It is the policy of the Python Software Foundation to allow the use
of "PyCon" for conferences that focus on Python the programming
language, have adopted a code of conduct compatible with that of the
PSF, and allow anyone to attend the conference subject to a
reasonable conference fee. Use of the trademark is subject to
approval by the PSF trademarks committee (write to
psf\-trademarks at python.org).


The PSF may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be
published and announced by the PSF.


*Version 1\.0 of this "PyCon" trademark policy was adopted
by the PSF board on 2014\-05\-16\.*
