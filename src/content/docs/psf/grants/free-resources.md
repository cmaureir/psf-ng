# 



While the PSF is preparing to re\-launch it's grants program, we put together a list of free (some limited) resources our community can use to host virtual conferences, user group meetings, and sprints!




| Basic needs for virtual events | Free options |
| --- | --- |
| Ways to schedule, promote, and take registrations for your event | 1\. <https://allevents.in/> may be a good free alternative for meetup.com, but not as robust, not as strong for long term use, and you only get 200 credits for sending invitations out.  2\. [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/organizer/pricing/) is free to use for free events  3\. Use social media! Organizers can send social media outreach material (such as tweets, blurbs for mailing lists) about their events to the [PSF to share](mailto:psf@python.org). |
| Video \& voice presentation platforms | 1\. [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) (recommended up to 8 people)  2\. Google Meet ([up to 100 participants for free](https://apps.google.com/meet/))  3\.

Zoom ([free up to 100 participants and 40 min cap](https://zoom.us/pricing))  6\. Discord [(supports free video calls with up to 25 participants)](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video) |
| Software for creating presentations | 1\. [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/)  2\. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)  3\. [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)  4\. <https://cryptpad.fr/>  5\. Software that comes with your computer |
| Text chat platforms | 1\. [IRC](http://www.irchelp.org/)  2\. [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/)  3\. [Discord](https://discord.com/new) (note: hosting a server for these could cost money) |
