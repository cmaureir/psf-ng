# [Introduction](#id1)


[The Python Software Foundation](/psf/) relies on volunteer efforts
to achieve many of its goals. The PSF Community Service Awards are a formal
way for the PSF Board of Directors to offer recognition of work which,
in its opinion, significantly improves the Foundation's fulfillment of
its mission and benefits the broader Python community. The intention
of these awards is to demonstrate that service to the Python community
does lead to recognition and reward, rather than to provide a direct
incentive to contributors.


Awards will be made periodically, normally every three months,
although the Board may choose to consider awards at other times. Any
PSF member is entitled to propose an award at any time, stating the
reasons for which the award is merited. Proposals should be made
confidentially to the Board by sending email to [psf@python.org](mailto:psf@python.org).


The minutes of award considerations will not name the individuals
concerned unless an award is made. The Board will contact proposers
to keep them informed of the status of their proposals (such as when
the proposal will receive Board consideration).


In the event that more than one award is proposed in a given period
the Board may elect to hold over a proposal. Awards will be
considered in the order in which they are received.


While it would be unusual for a single individual to receive multiple
awards, repeated awards will be appropriate to acknowledge ongoing
contributions. Recipients need not be Foundation members (though
receiving an award may be an indication that consideration for
membership is appropriate).


Recognition will take the form of an award certificate plus both of the following:


1. A cash award of $599\. (Non\-US based recipients will be subject to Federal US tax withholding of 30% unless all requirements are met, according to our Vendor Policies page. Contact [accounting@python.org](mailto:accounting@python.org) with any questions.)
2. Free registration at all future PyCon US events, and the opportunity to apply for a travel grant for the recipient's travel and accommodation expenses. (Receipts will be required for all reimbursements.)


The Board should consider awards at any quarterly meeting where a member award proposal has been received since the last award consideration. At each such meeting where no proposal has been received within the preceding three months the Board may, at its discretion, make an award to an individual nominated by the Board.

[PSF blog article](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/03/2010-q1-community-service-awards.html):


* **Ken Whitesell** has been a PyCon supporter for a very long time. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s
hard to remember a time when Ken wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t working behind the
reception desk to make sure that delegates received all the help they
need. Ken has also done sterling work in presenting many tutorials at
PyCon, and has evangelized Python to the commercial world over a
long period.
* **Yarko Tymciurak** has provided several years meritorious service in
developing and maintaining electronic registration and payment
systems for PyCon. He has also shown exceptional dedication to
providing high levels of customer service to both delegates and
sponsors, going above and beyond the call of duty in assisting with
registration issues.




# [December 2009](#id53)

# [October 2009](#id54)


The following awards were announced on October 25, 2009 in a [PSF blog
article](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/10/third-quarter-community-service-awards.html):


* **Noufal Ibrahim** was nominated for heading up the organizing team
for the recent (and very successful) first PyCon India conference
held on September 26 and 27 in Bangalore, attracting 450
delegates. Although Noufal was "first among equals" this award also
recognizes the work of everyone who helped to make the inaugural
conference so successful.
* **Barry Warsaw**. Many people are unaware of the huge volume of
mail that is processed by software written in Python every hour of
every day. This is because they don't know about the Mailman
project, which was Barry's brainchild. Barry, a founding member of
the Foundation, also acted as release manager for several recent
Python releases.




# [June 2009](#id55)


The following awards were announced on June 18, 2009 in a [PSF blog
article](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/06/second-quarter-community-service-awards.html):


* **Stephan Deibel** was last year's outgoing chairman after four
years in harness. This year Stephan has stepped down as a director,
after helping to ensure that the Foundation's bylaws were
reorganized. Stephan developed [pythonology.com](http://pythonology.com) to promote Python, and his work as
founder of [Wingware](http://wingware.com/) and a developer of
the Wing IDE has also had a significant impact.
* **Sean Reifschneider** has master\-minded the [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org) networking every time it has worked, and
without the support of this always helpful and reliably competent
[tummy.com](http://tummy.com/) director our conferences simply
would not have been the same.




# [March 2009](#id56)


The following awards were announced on March 29, 2009, at PyCon 2009
in Chicago ([PSF blog article](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/04/psf-community-awards-march-2009.html)):


* **Mary Rush** has given selflessly for four years now, staffing the
registration desk and providing a friendly face for PyCon.
* **Carl Karsten** has been a great asset to PyCon. His energy and
enthusiasm have helped PyCon reach new highs.




# [August 2008](#id57)


The following awards were announced on August 7, 2008 ([PSF blog
article](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/08/georg-brandl-and-brett-cannon-to.html)):


* **Georg Brandl** has been an enthusiastic contributor to the core
for several years, and a while ago stunned the Python development
world by building [the Sphinx documentation system](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) as an alternative to the LaTeX\-based
system we had been using previously, and converting [the Python
documentation](http://docs.python.org/dev/) to use it.
* **Brett Cannon** has also been an active core developer for many
years, but was nominated for his infrastructure work in migrating
the [Python bug\-tracking system](http://bugs.python.org/) off of
SourceForge to our own Roundup instance, and for his efforts keeping
[the Python developer introduction](http://www.python.org/dev/intro/) updated.




# [March 2008](#id58)


The following awards were announced on March 16, 2008, during [PyCon
in Chicago](http://us.pycon.org/2008/) (and followed up with [a PSF
blog post](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/03/psf-community-awards.html)):


* **Matthew Dixon Cowles**: Matthew has been a tireless (and
unfailingly polite) responder to the many users of [the python\-help
mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-help), used by
those seeking assistance not readily available through other
channels. This assistance covers not only elementary questions but
also quite advanced ones. Matthew has been a member of the Python
community for many years, patiently answering questions and
enlightening those who seek to get more out of the Python language.
* **Brad Knowles**: Brad has managed the python.org e\-mail since I can
remember, and it's down to him that our lists and newsgroups are so
blissfully free of spam. It's hard to appreciate the sheer volume of
mail that Brad handles, and he is fiercely defensive of our domain's
status on the Internet. Keeping the e\-mail flowing is essential not
just to the PSF but also to all the users of mailing lists and
newsgroups. Brad does all this not because he is a big Python user,
but because it needs to be done. This is the community service ethic
at its best.
* **Peter Kropf** and **Martin Thomas**: Peter and Martin are probably
best known to those people who want to employ Python programmers, as
they have jointly been almost the sole workforce behind [the Python
Job Board](/community/jobs/) for the last several years. The fact
that the Job Board exists, and is available free of charge to anyone
looking to hire people with Python skills, is possibly more central
to Python's rise in popularity than we appreciate. PyCon chairman
David Goodger paid tribute to the Job Board as helping him out of
unemployment in his opening remarks this year, and I know there are
dozens if not hundreds of others who should be similarly grateful to
Peter and Martin.
